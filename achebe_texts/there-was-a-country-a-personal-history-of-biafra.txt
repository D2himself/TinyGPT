INTRODUCTION

An Igbo proverb tells us that a man who does not know where the rain
began to beat him cannot say where he dried his body.
The rain that beat Africa began four to five hundred years ago, from the
“discovery” of Africa by Europe, through the transatlantic slave trade, to the
Berlin Conference of 1885. That controversial gathering of the world’s leading
European powers precipitated what we now call the Scramble for Africa, which
created new boundaries that did violence to Africa’s ancient societies and
resulted in tension-prone modern states. It took place without African
consultation or representation, to say the least.
Great Britain was handed the area of West Africa that would later become
Nigeria, like a piece of chocolate cake at a birthday party. It was one of the most
populous regions on the African continent, with over 250 ethnic groups and
distinct languages. The northern part of the country was the seat of several
ancient kingdoms, such as the Kanem-Bornu—which Shehu Usman dan Fodio
and his jihadists absorbed into the Muslim Fulani Empire. The Middle Belt of
Nigeria was the locus of the glorious Nok Kingdom and its world-renowned
terra-cotta sculptures. The southern protectorate was home to some of the
region’s most sophisticated civilizations. In the west, the Oyo and Ife kingdoms
once strode majestically, and in the midwest the incomparable Benin Kingdom
elevated artistic distinction to a new level. Across the Niger River in the East,
the Calabar and the Nri kingdoms flourished. If the Berlin Conference sealed her
fate, then the amalgamation of the southern and northern protectorates
inextricably complicated Nigeria’s destiny. Animists, Muslims, and Christians
alike were held together by a delicate, some say artificial, lattice.1
Britain’s indirect rule was a great success in northern and western Nigeria,
where affairs of state within this new dispensation continued as had been the
case for centuries, with one exception—there was a new sovereign, Great

Britain, to whom all vassals pledged fealty and into whose coffers all taxes were
paid.2 Indirect rule in Igbo land proved far more challenging to implement.
Colonial rule functioned through a newly created and incongruous establishment
of “warrant chiefs”—a deeply flawed arrangement that effectively confused and
corrupted the Igbo democratic spirit.3
Africa’s postcolonial disposition is the result of a people who have lost the
habit of ruling themselves. We have also had difficulty running the new systems
foisted upon us at the dawn of independence by our “colonial masters.” Because
the West has had a long but uneven engagement with the continent, it is
imperative that it understand what happened to Africa. It must also play a part in
the solution. A meaningful solution will require the goodwill and concerted
efforts on the part of all those who share the weight of Africa’s historical burden.
Most members of my generation, who were born before Nigeria’s
independence, remember a time when things were very different. Nigeria was
once a land of great hope and progress, a nation with immense resources at its
disposal—natural resources, yes, but even more so, human resources. But the
Biafran war changed the course of Nigeria. In my view it was a cataclysmic
experience that changed the history of Africa.

—
There is some connection between the particular distress of war, the particular
tension of war, and the kind of literary response it inspires. I chose to express
myself in that period through poetry, as opposed to other genres.4 My Biafran
poems and other poetry are collected in two volumes—Beware, Soul Brother,
Poems (which was published as Christmas in Biafra and Other Poems in
America) in 1971 and Collected Poems in 2004. As a group these poems tell the
story of Biafra’s struggle and suffering. I have made the conscious choice to
juxtapose poetry and prose in this book to tell complementary stories, in two art
forms.
It is for the sake of the future of Nigeria, for our children and grandchildren,
that I feel it is important to tell Nigeria’s story, Biafra’s story, our story, my story.
I begin this story with my own coming of age in an earlier and, in some
respects, a more innocent time. I do this both to bring readers unfamiliar with
this landscape into it at a human level and to be open about some of the sources
of my own perspective.

Pioneers of a New Frontier
My father was born in the last third of the nineteenth century, an era of great
cultural, economic, and religious upheaval in Igbo land. His mother had died in
her second childbirth, and his father, Achebe, a refugee from a bitter civil war,
did not long survive his wife. And so my father was raised by his maternal uncle,
Udoh.
It was this maternal uncle, as fate would have it, who received in his
compound the first party of English clergy in his town. The new arrivals,
missionaries of a new religion, Christianity, had already “conquered” the Yoruba
heartland and were expanding their footprint in Igbo land and the rest of
southern Nigeria with their potent, irresistible tonic of evangelism and education.
A story is told of how Udoh, a very generous and tolerant man, finally asked his
visitors to move to a public playground on account of their singing, which he
considered too dismal for a living man’s compound. But he did not discourage
his young nephew from associating with the singers.1
My father was an early Christian convert and a good student. By 1904 he
was deemed to have received enough education at St. Paul’s Teachers College in
Awka to be employed as a teacher and an evangelist in the Anglican Mission. He
was a brilliant man, who deeply valued education and read a great deal—mainly
the Bible and religious books, periodicals, and almanacs from the Church
Mission Society.
My mother, Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam, was an extraordinary woman. As a
student of the legendary missionary and evangelist Miss Edith Warner she
received a primary school education, which was a phenomenal feat at the time,
especially for a woman. My mother joined my father on his travels through
much of Igbo land to spread the gospel.
My parents were among the first of their people to successfully integrate
traditional values with the education and new religion brought by the Europeans.
I still marvel at how wholeheartedly they embraced strangers from thousands of
miles away, with their different customs and beliefs.
It is from these two outstanding and courageous individuals that my five
siblings—Frank, Zinobia, John, Augustine, and Grace—and I got our deep love

for education and the pursuit of knowledge.

The Magical Years
On November 16, 1930, in Nnobi, near my hometown of Ogidi, providence
ushered me into a world at a cultural crossroads. By then, a long-standing clash
of Western and African civilizations had generated deep conversations and
struggles between their respective languages, religions, and cultures.
Crossroads possess a certain dangerous potency. Anyone born there must
wrestle with their multiheaded spirits and return to his or her people with the
boon of prophetic vision, or accept, as I have, life’s interminable mysteries.
My initiation into the complicated world of Ndi Igbo1 was at the hands of my
mother and my older sister, Zinobia, who furnished me with a number of
wonderful stories from our ancient Igbo tradition. The tales were steeped in
intrigue, spiced with oral acrobatics and song, but always resolute in their moral
message. My favorite stories starred the tortoise mbe, and celebrated his
mischievous escapades. As a child, sitting quietly, mesmerized, story time took
on a whole new world of meaning and importance. I realize, reminiscing about
these events, that it is little wonder I decided to become a storyteller. Later in my
literary career I traveled back to the magic of the storytelling of my youth to
write my children’s books: How the Leopard Got His Claws, Chike and the
River, The Drum: A Children’s Story, and The Flute.

—
When I think about my mother the first thing that comes to my mind is how
clearly the description “the strong, silent type” fit her. Mother was neither
talkative nor timid but seemed to exist on several planes—often quietly escaping
into the inner casements of her mind, where she engaged in deep, reflective
thought. It was from her that I learned to appreciate the power and solace in
silence.
Mother’s education prepared her for leadership, and she distinguished herself
in the church and as the head of a group of expatriate women from the ancient
town of Awka who were married in Ogidi. She always treated others with respect
and exuded a calm self-confidence. Mother brought a remarkable, understated
elegance to every activity in which she engaged. She had a particularly attractive

way of making sure she got her point across without being overbearing or
intimidating. It is her peaceful determination to tackle barriers in her world that
nailed down a very important element of my development—the willingness to
bring about change gently.
We were Christians, though the interreligious struggle was still evident in our
time. There were occasions when one would suddenly realize there were sides,
and one was on one or another. Perhaps the most important event that illustrates
this was what has come to be known in my family as the “Kola nut incident.”
The story came out that a neighbor who was a relative of mine and someone
the Christians would refer to as “a heathen,” was passing on the road one day
and watched quietly as my mother pulled down a small Kola nut branch from a
tree in her compound and picked a ripe fruit. Now one often forgot that there
were taboos about picking Kola nuts. Traditionally no one was allowed to pick
them from the tree; they were supposed to ripen, fall, and then be collected from
the ground, and by men—not by women. The Kola nut was a sacred fruit and
had a very distinct and distinguished role to play in Igbo life and culture.
The neighbor reported this incident to the menfolk, who then exaggerated the
“insult to our traditions.” But Mother insisted that she had every right to pick the
fruit, particularly from a tree in her own compound. I did not think up to that
moment that my mother was a fighter. There was pressure to punish my mother,
though it did not go anywhere in the end. Looking back, one can appreciate the
fact that she had won a battle for Christianity, women’s rights, and freedom.
The most powerful memories of my father are the ones of him working as a
catechist and a teacher. He read constantly and had a small library. My father
also had a number of collages and maps hanging on the walls, and books that he
encouraged his children to read. He would often walk us through the house
telling stories linked to each prized possession. It was from him that I was
exposed to the magic in the mere title of William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer
Night’s Dream and to an Igbo translation of John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s
Progress.
The Bible played an important role in my education. My parents often read
passages out loud to us during prayer time and encouraged us, when we were all
able, to read and memorize several passages. Sunday school continued this
tradition of Christian evangelical education, this time with several other children
from the village. Education was so important to my father that he often would
sponsor a bright child from an underprivileged background, reminding us that he
too, as an orphan, had received providence’s benefaction.

The center of our family’s activities was St. Philip’s Church, Ogidi, a large
Gothic-style parish church that my father helped establish. It was constructed on
an impressive, open ilo, or piece of open grass, on the outskirts of Ogidi. It was
an imposing structure for its time, built with wood, cement, mud, and stone.
Local lore holds that my father took part in the building of the church from its
foundations. My father also helped conduct Sunday service, translate sermons
into Igbo, and arrange the sanctuary and vestry. I remember waking up early to
help out, carrying his bag for him as we set out at cock crow for the parish
church.
Eucharist on Sundays often lasted more than two hours. For those who were
not asleep by the end of the proceedings, the fire and brimstone sermons from
the pulpit made attendance worthwhile. There was an occasional outburst of
uncontrollable laughter, when the rector, an Englishman, enthusiastically drank
all the remaining wine at the end of communion, wiping his mouth with the back
of his hand. A crowd favorite was the inaccurate translations of Igbo words into
English, such as the word ike, which is an Igbo word that can mean “strength” or
“buttocks” depending on the skill or mischief of the translator!
I can say that my whole artistic career was probably sparked by this tension
between the Christian religion of my parents, which we followed in our home,
and the retreating, older religion of my ancestors, which fortunately for me was
still active outside my home. I still had access to a number of relatives who had
not converted to Christianity and were called heathens by the new converts.
When my parents were not watching I would often sneak off in the evenings to
visit some of these relatives. They seemed so very content in their traditional
way of life and worship. Why would they refuse to become Christians, like
everyone else around them? I was intent on finding out.
My great-uncle, Udoh Osinyi, was able to bestride both worlds with great
comfort. He held one of the highest titles in all of Igbo land—ozo. I was very
interested in my great-uncle’s religion, and talking to him was an enriching
experience. I wouldn’t give up anything for that, including my own narrow, if
you like, Christian background.
In Igbo cosmology there are many gods. A person could be in good stead
with one god and not the other—ogwugwu could kill a person despite an
excellent relationship with udo. As a young person that sort of complexity meant
little to me. A later understanding would reveal the humility of the traditional
religion with greater clarity. Igbo sayings and proverbs are far more valuable to
me as a human being in understanding the complexity of the world than the

doctrinaire, self-righteous strain of the Christian faith I was taught. This other
religion is also far more artistically satisfying to me. However, as a catechist’s
son I had to suppress this interest in our traditions to some extent, at least the
religious component. We were church people after all, helping the local church
spread Christianity.
The relationship between my father and his uncle Udoh was instructive to
me. There was something deep and mystical about it, judging from the reverence
I heard in my father’s voice whenever he spoke about his old uncle.
My father was a man of few words, and I have always regretted that I did not
ask him more questions. But he took pains to tell me what he thought I needed to
know. He told me, for instance, in a rather oblique way of his one attempt to
convert his uncle Udoh. It must have been in my father’s youthful, heady,
proselytizing days! His uncle pointed to the awesome row of insignia of his three
titles—ichi ozo, ido idemili, ime omaalor. “What shall I do to these?” he asked
my father. It was an awesome question. He had essentially asked: “What do I do
to who I am? What do I do to history?”
An orphan child born into adversity, heir to the commotions, barbarities, and
rampant upheavals of a continent in disarray—it was not at all surprising that my
father would welcome the remedy proffered by diviners and interpreters of a
new word of God. But my great-uncle, a leader in his community, a moral, openminded man, a prosperous man who had prepared such a great feast when he
took the ozo title that his people gave him a praise name for it—was he to throw
all that away because some strangers from afar had said so?
At first glance it seemed to me that my father, a deeply religious man, was
not tolerant of our ancient traditions and religion. As he got older, however, I
noticed that he became more openly accommodating of the old ways of doing
things. By this time he had developed quite a reputation as a pious, disciplined,
honest catechist. He was widely known as onye nkuzi (“the teacher”), and the
villagers found him very trustworthy. Strangers would often drop off valuables at
our house for Father’s safe-keeping.
Those two—my father and his uncle—formed the dialectic that I inherited.
Udoh stood fast in what he knew, but he also left room for my father to seek
other answers. The answer my father found in the Christian faith solved many
problems, but by no means all.
As a young person my perspective of the world benefited, I think, from this
dichotomy. I wasn’t questioning in an intellectual way which way was right, or
better. I was simply more interested in exploring the essence, the meaning, the

worldview of both religions. By approaching the issues of tradition, culture,
literature, and language of our ancient civilization in that manner, without
judging but scrutinizing, a treasure trove of discovery was opened up to me.
I often had periods of oscillating faith as I grew older, periods of doubt, when
I quietly pondered, and deeply questioned, the absolutist teachings or the
interpretations of religion. I struggled with the certitude of Christianity—“I am
the Way, the Truth and the Life”—not its accuracy, because as a writer one
understands that there should be such latitude, but the desolation, the acerbity of
its meaning, the lack of options for the outsider, the other. I believe that this
question has subconsciously deeply influenced my writing. This is not peculiar
or particularly unique, as many writers, from Du Bois to Camus, Sartre and
Baldwin to Morrison, have also struggled with this conundrum of the outsider,
the other, in other ways, in their respective locales.
My father had a lot of praise for the missionaries and their message, and so
do I. I am a prime beneficiary of the education that the missionaries made a
major component of their enterprise. But I have also learned a little more
skepticism about them than my father had any need for. Does it matter, I ask
myself, that centuries before European Christians sailed down to us in ships to
deliver the Gospel and save us from darkness, other European Christians, also
sailing in ships, delivered us to the transatlantic slave trade and unleashed
darkness in our world?
Every generation must recognize and embrace the task it is peculiarly
designed by history and by providence to perform. From where I stand now I can
see the enormous value of my great-uncle, Udoh Osinyi, and his example of
fidelity. I also salute my father, Isaiah Achebe, for the thirty-five years he served
as a Christian evangelist and for all the benefits his work, and the work of others
like him, brought to our people. My father’s great gift to me was his love of
education and his recognition that whether we look at one human family or we
look at human society in general, growth can come only incrementally.

A Primary Exposure
I began my formal education at St. Philip’s Central School, in 1936 or
thereabout. The school had pupils from Ogidi and the surrounding towns. Most
who attended classes there had to walk alone several miles every day to get to
school. But things were simpler and safer in those days, and there was never a
story of child abductions or any unsavory incidents that I can recall.
I enjoyed school a great deal and was a hardworking pupil. I remember
looking forward excitedly to new lessons and information from our teachers.
Occasionally we received instruction from individuals who were not on the staff
of St. Philip’s. One particular, humorous event stands out: On a hot and humid
day during the wet season our geography teacher decided to move our entire
class outside to the cool shade of a large mango tree. After setting up the
blackboard he proceeded to give the class a lesson on the geography of Great
Britain. The village “madman” came by, and after standing and listening to the
teacher’s lesson for a short while, walked up to him, snatched the chalk from his
hand, wiped the blackboard, and proceeded to give us an extended lesson on
Ogidi, my hometown.
Amazingly, the teacher let all this take place without incident. Looking back,
it is instructive, in my estimation, that it was a so-called madman whose “clarity
of perspective” first identified the incongruity of our situation: that the pupils
would benefit not only from a colonial education but also by instruction about
their own history and civilization.

—
The headmaster of St. Philip’s Central School was a colorful, extraordinary Igbo
man—Jonathan Obimdike Okongwu. He was also known as: Ara eme ya eme na
uno akwukwo Okongwu or Ara eme ya eme, for short.1 He was one of a handful
of Nigerians who had attained the distinction of headmaster of an elementary
school. His reputation as a disciplinarian sent chills down the spines of all pupils
throughout the Eastern Region. St. Philip’s school lore holds that he once
spanked every pupil in every class in each form of the entire school in one day—
and continued the very next day where he left off!2 Okongwu’s unorthodox

methods produced top scores on exams, which placed his students in the best
boarding schools throughout West Africa, and made him one of the most sought
after headmasters in the entire region.3
Okongwu was transferred to St. Michael’s School, Aba, a well-regarded
school in one of the largest commercial cities in eastern Nigeria. Chike Momah
and Dr. Francis Egbuonu, who later became students at Government College,
Umuahia, completed their elementary school education there. My wife, Christie
Okoli, for a brief period, also attended that school. Christie recalls being the only
one in her class to evade Mr. Okongwu’s cane during a spelling lesson. The word
that produced a score of sore bottoms was “because.” For every word missed the
pupil was “rewarded” with a spanking. The majority of the pupils came up with
“becos, becus, or becoz.” They never forgot how to spell because ever again.
Okongwu was a pillar of the Igbo community for his time. He was
extensively admired for his achievements in education. It is difficult to convey
just how important teachers like Okongwu, who were seriously committed to
their work, were to the Igbo community, particularly as that is no longer the case
today. Education, the white man’s knowledge, was a collective aspiration of the
entire community. It was the path to individual and family success, and
headmaster Okongwu and others like him held the proverbial keys to the
kingdom.
Okongwu was a generous man and sponsored a number of children in
various schools in Nigeria and abroad. There is a well-known story of how he
sent one of his nephews to America to study. He clearly had great expectations
for his nephew. In those days, men like Okongwu, who had the means, sent
family members abroad to advance their education with the hope that they would
return and improve the standard of living of their family and community.
Apparently this nephew did quite well and earned his PhD. Sadly, just before he
returned to Nigeria, he became quite ill and died. Okongwu was devastated.4
The last time I saw Okongwu was at the train station in Enugu, the capital of
the Eastern Region. He came there to see his son Sonny Chu Okongwu off to
Government College, Umuahia. He was standing, leaning on the railing with his
right hand holding on to the bars. He spotted me from a distance and called me
over, introduced me to his son, and asked me to “take care of Sonny at
Government College.” It struck me that the senior Okongwu appeared unhappy.
The loss of his nephew clearly had taken a lot out of him.

Leaving Home
For a brief period I spent some time living with my older brother John, who was
working at Central School, Nekede, as a teacher. My father had wanted John to
follow in his footsteps and become a teacher too. John was a gifted student and
successfully fulfilled that dream.
It was John who, quite wisely, thought my own education would be enhanced
if I lived with him in a school environment. So I packed up my few belongings
and set out with my older brother to Nekede, near the present capital of Imo
state, Owerri, about forty-three miles from my ancestral home of Ogidi. That
was the first year I spent away from my parents, and at the time Nekede seemed
like a distant country.
John enrolled me in Central School, where I prepared for my entrance
examination into Government College. The regional center for the exam was St.
Michael’s School, and John helped me make the trip from Nekede to Aba.
Before I arrived Okongwu apparently announced to the students of St.
Michael’s, in Igbo: “Onwe nwa onye Ogidi ana akpo Albert Achebe, na
akwadobe inene akwukwo-a; oga ama unu nmili.” (The loose translation is:
“There is a young man called Albert Achebe from Ogidi, who is coming to take
the entrance examination with the students in this school. . . . [H]e will beat all
of you in all subjects in the examination.”1) This, clearly, did not endear me to
my fellow pupils at St. Michael’s but piqued the interest of future longtime
friends, like the brilliant Chike Momah.
Afterward I returned to Nekede for the remainder of the school year. Nekede
was a treasure trove of Igbo culture. Our ancient traditions continued to fascinate
me, and I sought an alternative education outside the classroom, from the local
villagers. The old men in Nekede spoke respectfully about the Otamiri River and
the chief deity for which it is named. The Otamiri deity is a female who,
according to legend, purified the land of evil and would claim the lives of
interlopers who wandered into the area for mischief. It was said that no one had
ever drowned in her waters unless they had committed evil deeds or
contemplated diabolical acts.
It was in Nekede that I was introduced to mbari and the sophistication of

Igbo phenomenological thought. The Owerri Igbo, who lived near Owerri
township, saw mbari as art engaged in the process and celebration of life. A mud
house was often built with decorated walls and crowned with either corrugated
metal or a thatch roof made of intricately woven palm leaves and spines. Inside,
center stage on an elevated mud platform, an observer would find life-size
sculptures of the constituent parts of the Owerri Igbo world: Alusi—deities—
such as Otamiri and Ani, the earth goddess; and men, women, children, soldiers,
animals, crops, and foreigners (mainly Europeans), all seated. The inclusion of
the Europeans, a great tribute to the virtues of African tolerance and
accommodation, was an example of the positive acknowledgment of strangers
who had ventured into their midst. There would also be depictions from ancient
mythology, as well as scourges, diseases, and other unpleasant things. The
purpose of this art form was to invoke protection from the gods for the people
through the celebration of the world these villagers lived in—in other words,
through art as celebration.2

The Formative Years at Umuahia and
Ibadan
It was not long after my foray into the metaphysical world of the Owerri Igbo
that I was to leave my traditional classroom in the forests of Nekede for the
second stage of my formal education, secondary school. There is a certain sense
of mystery that I feel when I look back to those times, because things we
encounter in life that leave the greatest impressions on us are usually not clear.
My elder brother John was a very brilliant man. I still say he was the most
brilliant of all of us. He was very eloquent, and he would correct my spoken
English. I often wondered about John. . . . How did he gain such control of the
English language? John had not been to university but had received a secondary
school education at Dennis Memorial Grammar School (DMGS) in Onitsha. All
my brothers attended this legendary school, which had been built by the Church
Mission Society—Frank had attended, John went there, and it was where
Augustine was to go. The school was very imposing, with its red earth–brick,
limestone-and-wood colonial architecture accentuated by Doric columns, and
cathedral-height roofs. And their uniform—the dark red shirt, pants, and cap—
was very impressive. DMGS was the place.
In 1944, I took a national entrance examination for the British public schools
of the day, and I also was admitted to Dennis Memorial Grammar School and
Government College, Umuahia. Now when John was told that I had been
admitted to both Umuahia and his alma mater, with full scholarships to both, he
suggested I go to Umuahia. Though Umuahia’s location was very remote, its
status as a “government college,” set up by the colonial government, reassured
my parents. Following a period of deliberation and debate, the consensus in my
family was that I go to this fairly new school in faraway Umuahia, even though
we had no relatives there.
I also privately wished to go to Government College, Umuahia, because I
wanted to do something different from my brothers. Umuahia, a new elite
boarding school established in 1929, was rapidly developing a reputation as the
Eton of the East, and I fancied receiving an education akin to the royals of
England!

The Anglican Protestants of the Church Mission Society, as well as the
Methodists, Baptists, and Roman Catholics, had built missionary schools
throughout the South and Middle Belt of Nigeria. These new government
colleges—exemplified by Government College, Umuahia, and Government
College, Ibadan—were built to continue the tradition of educational excellence
established by even older secondary schools, King’s College and Queen’s
College, both in Lagos. Between these four schools—King’s, Queen’s, Umuahia,
and Ibadan—we had some of the very best secondary schools in the British
Empire. As a group, these schools were better endowed financially, had excellent
amenities, and were staffed with first-rate teachers, custodians, instructors,
cooks, and librarians. Of course today, under Nigerian control, these schools
have fallen into disrepair, and are nothing like they were in their heyday.
Shortly after taking the national entrance examination I received a letter in
the mail addressed to me explaining that I was under consideration for admission
to Umuahia. That had to be the first letter I had ever received in my life.
I traveled to Umuahia to be interviewed by a former principal, a very tall and
large man—I believe his name was Mr. Thorp. My interviewer first asked why I
did not reply to the letter he wrote me offering me admission. I said I did not
know that I was supposed to reply, and he picked up a copy of the letter and
read, “Please acknowledge receipt.” I did not know the meaning of that phrase,
and I said to myself, “Well, I am not getting in at this point.” But after a little
more conversation he gave me admission to his school.
As the first day of school approached I was overtaken by a sense of
excitement and trepidation. I had never been to Umuahia before my interview; in
fact, I did not know of anyone who had been to Umuahia. I was to travel first by
lorry to Enugu, and then by train to Umuahia.
I arrived at Umuahia railway station alone. A man and his son approached
me. The man asked me whether I was going to Umudike, the village where the
secondary school was located, and I replied “Yes, sah.” He was going there too,
with his son. They had hired two bicycles, and he suggested I ride with them. I
carried his son, who was considerably smaller than I, on the handlebars of the
bicycle to Umudike, which was about three and a half miles from the railway
station.
As we sped off, I kept thanking this man for the help. I was completely
surprised at the hospitality and warmth that greeted me on my first day in school.
His son became a friend, naturally, because he was the first “Umuahian” I had
met. Later that semester I would discover that this lad, who would become a

renowned physician, Dr. Francis Egbuonu, had come to Umuahia from St.
Michael’s School, Aba. It was, coincidentally, the very same school that another
very close friend of mine, Chike Momah, had attended.

THE UMUAHIA EXPERIENCE
Government College, Umuahia, was built on a sprawling, parklike campus at the
fringes of a tropical forest. The grounds were dotted with large evergreen trees
on well-maintained lawns and crisscrossed by hand-crafted stone pathways that
were bordered by manicured hedges. The buildings—wood-framed brick-andstucco bungalows surrounded by wide verandas—were adorned with shuttered
windows and crowned with large metal roofs. The vaulted-ceiling design also
enhanced ventilation and tempered the tropical heat. Most of the structures
rested on elevated foundations or stilts—to protect them from floods and to keep
termites, wild animals, serpents, and rodents out.
There were three dormitories at Umuahia—the Niger, Nile, and School
houses. I was assigned to Niger house and once there unpacked my few
belongings in my dormitory locker. In my time the school had about two
hundred students, and our lives were strictly regimented, with literally every
hour slated for an activity.
One of the most thrilling peculiarities of the Umuahia experience was the
culture of playing cricket. Not all secondary schools in the area played the game;
soccer was far more commonplace. Cricket matches were often organized
between: Government College, Umuahia; King’s College, Lagos; Government
College, Ibadan; and a few other elite secondary schools.
Umuahia had a huge cricket field, which had a beautiful grass lawn and a
clear sand pitch area with wooden wickets. It was cared for almost more
carefully than grass anywhere else in the school. In the afternoons, cricket
matches were packed, and the bleachers and grandstands had scarcely an empty
spot.
Cricket was not a game that I knew anything about before coming to
Umuahia. Over time I began to appreciate that this was a very important global
sport, and that it was very popular in literally every part of the British Empire.
The schoolmasters referred to the game as one for “gentlemen” and made sure
Umuahia athletes played it “properly”—dressed in immaculate white shirts and
trousers, gloves, knee-high pads, and helmets. I was not known for my athletic

ability, but Chike Momah and Christopher Okigbo were particularly good
batsmen and bowlers of the sport.
Christopher Okigbo was a very extraordinary person. He was two years
below me, but Christopher was not one to allow two years to get in his way. He
quickly became one of my closest friends.
He was born in Ojoto, in Anambra state, and came from a highly talented
family, part of the so-called Okigbo trio of intellectual giants that included his
older brother, the late legendary economist Dr. Pius Okigbo, and their cousin
Professor Bede Okigbo, the renowned agronomist.1
Christopher was just somebody you could not ignore or suppress. He struck
people because he was so energetic, and so fearless. He was somebody who
would walk into a room, sit down, and start learning to play the school piano
without any prior exposure. He had an innate understanding of what was
required to play the instrument without the regimented, torturous, orthodox
lessons. Christopher was a talented artist and a sports hero, and he had a keen
mind that won him the admiration of many of the British schoolmasters. He
quickly became very popular throughout Umuahia.
His reputation for mischievous exploits preceded him. I think the first time
he got the attention of the entire school was when the principal, William
Simpson, decided that there was a lot of food waste coming from the kitchen; in
other words, it seemed we were being given too much food to eat! Simpson
decided to give food not according to one’s academic year—the pupils in the
higher classes were given more food than those in the junior classes. Simpson
felt that this practice was not a very good idea, and that it led to a waste of food.
A better arrangement, he thought, was for people to be given food according to
their weight. Before we knew what was happening, Christopher, who was
slightly built, had talked with the dining prefect, and we noticed that he was now
in the food equivalent of heavyweights, receiving more food than his classmates!
There was a strong culture of meritocracy and a very high quality of
instruction at Umuahia. I quickly noticed that there were very bright boys in my
class, yet there was a sense of friendly competition that pervaded our academic
life. I made friends gradually at school, at first mainly with pupils I met in the
dormitory, then with a number of others in the classroom, through partnerships
that the class master set up for assignments and projects. Benjamin Uzochukwu
became one of my closest friends at the beginning of the first semester; he later
qualified as an engineer, after studying in Great Britain, and became the director
of the Federal Department of Public Works in Lagos.

Ekpo Etien Inyang was another close friend. He was one of my most brilliant
classmates—he became a physician—but unfortunately he later committed
suicide. We had very different backgrounds, especially in terms of religion.
When he arrived at Umuahia, the school officials discovered that he had not
been baptized. Most of us did not ask fellow pupils whether they were baptized
or not; one just assumed that if you were a Christian you would have been. But
Inyang’s father was not a particularly religious person. So when he became an
upperclassman Inyang decided to be baptized, and after subjecting himself to the
religion classes and preparation that were required, he asked me to be his
godfather. So I had a godson who was the same age as me. That was quite an
extraordinarily moving gesture on his part, to ask me to step in on his behalf in
this capacity.
Six of us, including Inyang and me, were promoted to the second-year from
the first-year class during our second term at Umuahia. Students with a record of
excellent work and who were the best performers in their respective years were
combined into a larger second-year class. It was an honor, but it also meant that I
began to see a large majority of my contemporaries from my first-year class less
often, including my close friends Ben Uzochukwu and Chike Momah.
English was the language of instruction at Government College, Umuahia. It
was at Umuahia that I first truly understood the power and importance of that
unifying language. The schoolmasters, well aware that Nigeria had over 250
ethnic groups, had very carefully enrolled students from every nook and cranny
of the nation, where possible. While African languages and writing should be
developed, nurtured, and preserved, how else, I would wonder later, would I
have been able to communicate with so many boys from different parts of the
country and ethnic groups, speaking different languages, had we not been taught
one language?
Many of our teachers at the time were alumni from Cambridge, the
University of London, and other major British institutions of higher learning.
They included A. P. L. Slater, who was fondly called “Apples” by his close
associates and a few of us who were his former students. Shortly after I left
Umuahia, the duo R. H. Stone, a biology instructor, and A. B. Cozens, a onetime
principal of the college, arrived. Together Stone and Cozens published a very
famous biology textbook called Biology for Tropical Schools that was used
throughout Africa and beyond.
It was at Umuahia that I continued the introduction to the work of William
Shakespeare that my father had first made possible, as well as to Booker T.

Washington’s Up from Slavery, Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Dickens’s David
Copperfield, and Stevenson’s Treasure Island. We were blessed to have had
energetic, egalitarian principals such as the Reverend Robert Fisher and W. C.
Simpson, who created and encouraged, respectively, the “textbook act”—a time
between 4:00 P.M. and 6:00 P.M. when all textbooks had to be put away and novels
picked up and read.
Reading these books was a transforming experience, and I have written
elsewhere about the influence Umuahia had in educating many of the pioneers of
modern African literature—Vincent Chukwuemeka Ike, Christopher Okigbo,
Elechi Amadi, I. N. C Aniebo, Chike Momah, Gabriel Okara, and later Ken
Saro-Wiwa. Less often stated is the role the school played in producing leaders
in the fine arts, such as Ben Enwonwu, and politics, such as Jaja Wachukwu,
Nigeria’s first speaker of the House of Representatives and later ambassador to
the United Nations. Umuahia turned out other stars, such as Okoi Arikpo, Dr. E.
M. L. Endeley, and N. U. Akpan. The school also produced respected African
intellectuals such as: the agronomist Professor Bede Okigbo; the physician and
First Republic Minister of Health J. O. J. Okezie; Chu Okongwu, a former
minister of finance; Kelsey Harrison, a renowned professor of obstetrics; and
musician and professor Laz Ekwueme, among others.
We went through the designated courses in secondary school, and the last
examination that we took was the Cambridge School Certificate exam. There
were four classifications of grades: A for distinction, C for credit, P for pass, and
F for fail. Most pupils at Umuahia passed all their subjects. I passed my school
certificate exam with five distinctions and one credit. Inyang passed with six
distinctions and one credit. I narrowly graduated top of the class only because
the distinctions that I got were higher in the courses that I took despite the fact
that Inyang had more As in more courses. Whatever the case, I held Mr. Inyang
in great esteem, especially as he had an A in literature while I had a credit.
As I was completing my secondary school education at Government College,
Umuahia, the colonial government announced that it was predisposed to building
a University College in West Africa. There was some kind of competition—
would it be in the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) or in Nigeria? So a highpowered commission under Walter Elliott was sent to survey the situation on the
ground. Such was the reputation of Government College, Umuahia, that the
commission paid us a visit and spent a whole weekend at our school. Most of
them came to chapel service on Sunday morning, but Julian Huxley, the
biologist, roamed our extensive grounds, watching exotic birds with binoculars.

The Elliott Commission report led to the foundation of Nigeria’s first university
institution: a university college at Ibadan in a special relationship with London.
I finished secondary school and literally walked into University College,
Ibadan! Well, maybe not walked in. There was a nationwide examination, and I
came in first or second in the country. I won what was called a “major”
scholarship.2
I grew up at a time when the colonial educational infrastructure celebrated
hard work and high achievement, and so did our families and communities.
Government College, Umuahia, was so proud of my work that they put up a big
sign announcing my performance in the national entrance examination. That
notice stayed on the wall for years. My family was very pleased with my school
performance, from the end of primary school through to this time. No matter that
I was not known for my athletic ability; they encouraged me to read voraciously,
taking great pleasure in my nickname: Dictionary.
A very distinguished member of the colonial educational system—a British
gentleman—who was also the chairman of some important colonial council,
heard about my entrance examination result and came to our house to greet me.
Now, I had never encountered such a thing before. Surely people of that
distinction did not call on children? But here was this man, who was a very
important person in the British educational system, who thought that my work
deserved encouragement, recognition, and a visit from him. So clearly I had a
good beginning.
As a young man, surrounded by all this excitement, it seemed as if the
British were planning surprises for me at every turn, including the construction
of a new university! It is, of course, only a joke, but I am sure many of my
colleagues shared similar feelings. Here we were, a whole generation of students
who really could not have had any clear idea of going to university until these
events began to unfold.
It was a remarkable group—Chike Momah, Flora Nwapa, Mabel Segun, Ben
Obumselu, Emmanuel Obiechina, Kelsey Harrison, Gamaliel Onosode, Wande
Abimbola, Iya Abubakar, Adiele Afigbo, Igwe Aja-Nwachukwu, Theophilus
Adeleke Akinyele, Grace Alele Williams, Mohammed Bello, Elechi Amadi. A
bit later Wole Soyinka, J. P. Clark, Oluwokayo Oshuntokun, M. J. C. Echeruo,
Christopher Okigbo, Ayo Bamgbose, Christine Okoli (my future wife), Emeka
Anyaoku, Chukwuemeka Ike, Abiola Irele, Zulu Sofola, and several others.
These young men and women came from all over the country—from elite
secondary schools modeled on the public schools of England—Government

College, Umuahia, Dennis Memorial Grammar School, Government College,
Ibadan, and Abeokuta, King’s College, Lagos, and Queen’s College, Lagos.

THE IBADAN EXPERIENCE
Umuahia had a large contingent of students admitted to University College,
Ibadan, with a number of students winning at least minor scholarships.
I received my scholarship to study medicine at Ibadan. I wanted to be in the
arts but felt pressure to choose medicine instead. After a year of work I changed
to English, history, and theology, but by so doing I lost the bursary and was left
with the prospect of paying tuition.
I remember what the dean of the Faculty of Arts, Professor E. A. Cadle, said
to me when I went to ask to be moved from the sciences to the arts: in order to
get into the arts I had to have taken a school certificate exam in Latin, which was
not taught at Umuahia. I was faced with a difficult dilemma and spent some time
thinking about the ramifications of taking extra courses in Latin.
But providence had other plans. Soon after my conversation with Professor
Cadle an announcement came through from the University of London, our parent
institution, indicating that it was dropping the Latin requirement for admission
into the Faculty of Arts. The University of London argued that the native
languages of students from the British Commonwealth could stand in for the
Latin requirement. I was elated. I went back and asked Professor Cadle for
admission into the Arts Faculty. He brought out my file and told me that I was
admitted on the basis of my performance in physics and chemistry. He wanted
reassurance from me that I would be able to make such a fundamental shift in
academic focus and maintain good grades. After a little more conversation, he
admitted me to study English, history, and theology, and I moved from medicine
to the Arts Faculty.
My older brother Augustine Achebe, an engineer by training, had returned
from his studies in England and had landed a good job. On learning that I had
lost my bursary, Augustine gave me money he had saved up for his annual leave
so that I could pay the university tuition and continue my studies, which I did,
very pleasantly.
After graduation I did not have to worry about where I would go next. The
system was so well organized that as we left university most of us were instantly
absorbed into civil service, academia, business, or industry. We trusted—I did,

anyway—the country and its rulers to provide this preparatory education and
then a job to serve my nation. I was not disappointed. I went home to my village
at the end of the holiday and visited a secondary school within my district, called
the Merchants of Light, in Oba, near Ogidi. I asked the principal to give me a job
as an English teacher. And he did!
It helped that my colleague J. O. C. Ezeilo had completed a short tenure at
the same school and recommended it to me. Ezeilo is often described as
Nigeria’s leading mathematician, alongside Chike Obi. Ezeilo graduated from
University of London in 1953, with a first class honors in mathematics, an
amazing feat by any measure, and particularly extraordinary for the time. He
would go on to receive his PhD from Queens’ College, University of Cambridge,
in 1958, and then rise rapidly through the Nigerian academic ranks to become
vice chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and several other Nigerian
institutions of higher learning.3

Meeting Christie and Her Family
The school building at Merchants of Light was in disrepair and had a very small
library. I would often encourage my students to read by bringing in a copy of the
newspaper or by making a few more books from my own library available to
them. Like most young people, they were enthusiastic and interested pupils. I
spent about four months at this job. It was known to all that this would be a
temporary position, what the Americans call “a summer job,” because I had my
eyes farther afield.
A few months later, in 1954, I was notified of a job opening at what was then
called the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) in Enugu. I was offered a choice
by the search committee of coming to Enugu to interview or having them come
to me. I remember feeling quite entitled by this choice and proceeded to enjoy
the privilege by asking them to come to me, which they did. The team of mainly
Britons left to return to Enugu after an hour or so of interview questions. About a
week or so later I received a letter in the mail offering me a job, so I moved to
Enugu. I enjoyed my stint at the broadcasting house. Promotions came rapidly,
and within a very short period of time I had become the controller of the
Nigerian Broadcasting Service, Eastern Region.
At the end of the academic year, during the long vacation, the NBS offered
summer jobs to college students on vacation. They did not pay very well but
provided young people with exposure to the world of journalism, broadcasting,
and news reporting.
NBS was inundated with a large number of applicants during this particular
long vacation—not only students from my alma mater, University College,
Ibadan, but from those returning from studies abroad. A few weeks later one
could hear the unmistakable banter of young people as they milled about the
normally quiet halls of the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. As the controller I
had very little interaction with the students. I found all this excited commotion
amusing and got on with my work.
But soon after I was told by my secretary that a delegation of university
students wanted to speak with me about a matter of great importance. The
students trooped into my office led by their leader, Christie Okoli. She was a

beautiful young woman and very articulate, and when she spoke she caught my
attention. I was spellbound. In grave tones she announced the complaint of the
students: There was one student whose salary was higher than all the others, and
they wanted “equal pay for equal time.” I was kindly disposed toward them and
made sure that all of the students received the same remuneration for the work
that they did.
My interest in Christie grew rapidly into a desire to get to know her better. I
discovered, for instance, that she was from the ancient town of Awka, the
present-day capital of Anambra state. Awka held a soft spot in my heart because
it was my mother’s hometown, and it was known throughout Igbo land and
beyond for its skilled artisans and blacksmiths, who fashioned bronze, wood, and
metal carvings of a bold and haunting beauty.
Two years into our friendship, Christie and I were engaged.

—
Christie was from a very prominent Awka family. She was the daughter of one of
the most formidable Igbo men of the early twentieth century, Timothy
Chukwukadibia Okoli, and Mgboye Matilda Mmuo, who unfortunately died not
long after Christie was born.
“T. C. Okoli,” as he was widely known, was the son of a famous dibia, or
traditional medicine man, known from Arochukwu to Nri and from Onitsha to
Ogoja for skills that encompassed herbal medicine, mysticism, divination, and
magic. After a lifetime in the service of the ancient medical practice, Okoli gave
his son the name Chukwukadibia, which means “God is greater than a traditional
medicine man.” He encouraged his newborn son to seek a Christian life.
An early convert to Christianity in Igbo land, T. C. Okoli was one of the few
educated men of his time to attain the position of senior post- master in the
colonial Posts and Telecommunications (P&T) Department. He was a
profoundly generous man, and used his resources—which were quite
outstanding for a Nigerian at that time—to sponsor the education of gifted
children from scores of families in Awka. When he died at 102, in the mid1980s, all thirteen villages of the town celebrated his life for several days,
through both traditional and Christian rites and festivities.
Meeting Christie’s father for the first time was a great thrill for me. His
compound in Awka was always full of laughter. People visited constantly, some
to drink and make merry, others for favors and to pay their respects. I belonged

to the latter category.
We arrived, and Christie promptly took me to meet her dad.
“Papa” she said, “meet Chinua Achebe.”
We shook hands, and then the pleasantries gave way to a brief interview:
“Where are you from, young man?” “What do you do?” “Where did you go to
school?” “Who are your parents?” I quickly discovered that T. C. Okoli was an
Anglophile: He took pleasure in reciting passages in English from scripture,
Shakespeare, and poetry; and he had sent several of his children off to England
to advance their education. He was also a deeply respectful and kind man who
left me with a lasting lesson that I have never forgotten.
Christie and I were talking one evening when Okoli walked into the living
room. We exchanged greetings. He sat down and listened to our conversation
while sipping wine, watching the two of us talk. By this time I could say
confidently that he liked me. We got along very well. But in the course of the
conversation he missed something Christie said and asked for clarification. At
this prompting I responded by saying jestfully in Igbo: “Rapia ka ona aghaigha
agba,” or in English, “Don’t mind her . . . wagging her jaw. . . .”
T. C. Okoli sat up and rebuked me. He said: “Don’t say or imply that what
someone else has to say or is saying is not worth attending or listening to.” It
immediately struck me that I had to be careful about the way I handled someone
else’s words or opinions, especially Christie’s. Even when there was strong
disagreement, one had to remember to be discordant with respect.

Discovering Things Fall Apart
Soon after this educational encounter with my future father-in-law I moved to
Lagos to interview for a new position at the headquarters of what was now called
the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC). The Talks Department hired me
to maul over scripts and prepare them for broadcast. A tedious job, it
nevertheless honed my skill for writing realistic dialogue, a gift that I gratefully
tapped into when writing my novels.
In my second or third year at University College, Ibadan, I had offered two
short stories, “Polar Undergraduate” and “Marriage Is a Private Affair,” to the
University Herald, the campus magazine. They were accepted and published. I
published other stories during that time, including “The Old Order in Conflict
with the New” and “Dead Men’s Path.” In my third year I was invited to join the
editorial committee of the journal. A bit later I became the magazine’s editor.
At the University College, Ibadan, I was in contact with instructors of
literature, of religion, and of history who had spent several years teaching in
England. Studying religion was new to me and interesting because the focus
went beyond Christian theology to encompass wider scholarship—West African
religions. One of my professors in the Department of Religion, Dr. Parrinder,
was a pioneer in the area. He had done extensive research in West African
religions and cosmology, particularly in Dahomey, present-day Republic of
Benin. For the first time I was able to see the systems—including my own—
compared and placed side by side, which was really exciting. I also encountered
another professor, James Welch, in that department, an extraordinary man, who
had been chaplain to King George VI, chaplain to the BBC, and all kinds of
high-powered things before he came to University College, Ibadan.
My professors were excellent people and excellent teachers, but they were
not always the ones I needed. James Welch said to me, “We may not be able to
teach you what you need or what you want. We can only teach you what we
know.” I thought that was wonderful. Welch helped me understand that they
were not sent there to translate their knowledge to me in a way that would help
me channel my creative energies to tell my story of Africa, my story of Nigeria,
the story of myself. I learned, if I may put it simply, that my story had to come

from within me. Finding that inner creative spark required introspection, deep
personal scrutiny, and connection, and this was not something anybody could
really teach me.1
I have written elsewhere of how I fared when I entered a short story
competition in the Department of English, and how my teacher, who supervised
this competition, announced the result, which was that nobody who entered the
competition was good enough. I was more or less singled out as someone with
some promise, but the story I submitted lacked “form.” Understandably, I
wanted to find out more about what the professor meant by form. It seemed to
me that here was some secret competence that I needed to be taught. But when I
then applied some pressure on this professor to explain to me what form was, it
was clear that she was not prepared—that she could not explain it to me. And it
dawned on me that despite her excellent mind and background, she was not
capable of teaching across cultures, from her English culture to mine. It was in
these circumstances that I was moved to put down on paper the story that
became Things Fall Apart. I was conscripted by the story, and I was writing it at
all times—whenever there was any opening. It felt like a sentence, an
imprisonment of creativity. Through it all I did not neglect the employment for
which I earned a salary. Additional promotions came at NBC, and very swiftly,
particularly after most of the British returned to England; I was appointed
director of external broadcasting.
I worked on my writing mostly at night. I was seized by the story and I found
myself totally ensconced in it. It was almost like living in a parallel realm, a dual
existence not in any negative sense but in the way a hand has two surfaces,
united in purpose but very different in tone, appearance, character, and structure.
I had in essence discovered the writer’s life, one that exists in the world of the
pages of his or her story and then seamlessly steps into the realities of everyday
life.
The scribbling finally grew into a manuscript. I wanted to have not just a
good manuscript but a good-looking manuscript, because it seemed to me that
that would help to draw readers’ and publishers’ attention to the work. So I
decided, on the strength of a recommendation of an advertisement in a British
magazine or journal that described a company’s ability to transform a manuscript
through typing into an attractive document, to send it off for “polishing.”
What I did next, in retrospect, was quite naïve, even foolish. I put my
handwritten documents together, went to the post office, and had them parcel the
only copy of the manuscript I had to the London address of the highly

recommended typing agency that was in the business of manuscript preparation.
A letter came from this agency after a few weeks. They confirmed that they had
received my document and wrote that the next thing I should do was send them
thirty-two pounds, which was the cost of producing my manuscript. Now, thirtytwo pounds was a lot of money in 1956, and a significant slice of my salary, but
I was encouraged by the fact that I had received this information, this feedback,
and that the people sounded as if they were going to be of great value to me. So,
I sent off the payment as instructed.
What happened next was a near catastrophe. The typing agency, obviously
having received the money I sent, went silent. One week passed, then two, three,
four, five, six weeks, and I began to panic. I wrote two letters inquiring about the
status of the manuscript preparation and I got no answer.
One had a great deal of confidence and faith in the British system that we
had grown up in, a confidence and faith in British institutions. One trusted that
things would get where they were sent; postal theft, tampering, or loss of
documents were unheard-of. Today one would not even contemplate sending off
materials of importance so readily, either abroad or even locally, by mail.
The good luck was that at that point in my career I was working very closely
with a British former BBC Talks producer, Angela Beattie. Beattie was seconded
to the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation, for which she served as head of our
two-person department. She was the head of Talks and I was the Talks producer,
and we had a secretary, I believe, also from the BBC. It was to Beattie that I now
went to and told my story about the British typing agency. Ms. Angela Beattie
was shocked—she was a no-nonsense person.
“Give me their name and address,” she insisted.
Fortunately, she was about to go to England on leave, so she became the
perfect vehicle to carry my anguish to the typists in London. And she did it in
her distinctive way.
She arrived at the offices of the typing agency and asked to speak to the
manager, who showed up swiftly. Angela Beattie asked the manager sternly what
she had done with the manuscript that her colleague in Lagos, Nigeria, had sent.
Here, right before them, armed with a threat, was a well-connected woman who
could really make trouble for them. The people there were surprised and shaken.
“Now, I am going back to Nigeria in three weeks,” Angela Beattie said as she
left the agency’s office, “and when I get there, let us hope that the manuscript
you took money to prepare has been received by its owner, or else you will hear
more about it.” A few weeks later I received a handsome package in the mail. It

was my manuscript. I look back now at those events and state categorically that
had the manuscript been lost I most certainly would have been irreversibly
discouraged from continuing my writing career.
Later that year, in the fall of 1956 or thereabouts, I was selected to travel to
the British Broadcasting Corporation school in London where its staff were
trained. Bisi Onabanjo, a good friend of mine and the future governor of Ogun
state, was also among the small group of Nigerians attending this course. I had
not up to this time traveled outside Nigeria. In those days such trips were done
by boat, as commercial air flights from Lagos were not commonplace. London
was a brand-new and pleasant experience. I took advanced technical production
skills courses during my time at the BBC staff school, and in between my classes
was able to take in the sights and sounds of London, a city that remains one of
my favorite international capitals.
I took along my typed manuscript, hoping to bump into a number of writers
and publishers who could provide me with some advice about how best to get
the book published. I was fortunate to meet and make the acquaintance of
Gilbert Phelps, a British writer, who read the manuscript and was quite
enthusiastic about its literary merit and prospects for publication. When Mr.
Phelps kindly suggested that I hand over the manuscript to him to pass on to
some publishers he knew; I hesitated and told him that I needed some more time
to work on the novel. I was still wondering whether to publish it in three parts or
divide the work into three separate books.2
About a year later I wrote Gilbert Phelps and informed him that my novel,
Things Fall Apart, was ready, and he happily sent the manuscript off to a number
of publishers. There were several of instant rejections. Some did not even bother
to read it, jaundiced by their impression that a book with an African backdrop
had no “marketability.” Some of the responders found the very concept of an
African novel amusing. The book’s fortunes changed when it got into the hands
of Alan Hill and Donald McRae, executives of Heinemann. McRae had
extensive experience traveling throughout Africa and encouraged Heinemann to
publish the novel with a powerful recommendation: “This is the best first novel I
have read since the war.”3
It was under Alan Hill’s guidance that Things Fall Apart received immediate
and consistent support. The initial publication run from Heinemann was two
thousand hardcover copies. Things Fall Apart got some of its earliest
endorsements and positive reviews from Canada, where critics such as G. D.
Killam and the novelist Jean Margaret Laurence embraced it. Later the

postcolonial literary critics Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffin
helped introduce the book into the Australian and British literary establishments.
Michael Thelwell, Bernth Lindfors, Priscilla Tyler, Charles Larson, and
Catherine Lynnette Innes were some of the first intellectuals in America to pick
up the novel and present it to an American audience.
In England the book received positive reviews from the Observer, Time and
Tide, and The Times Literary Supplement, among other publications. But not all
the reviews were as kind or positive. Some failed to understand “the point of
African Literature” and what I and others were trying to achieve by telling our
own stories. It did the work a great deal of good, however, that the distinguished
novelist Angus Wilson and the well-respected literary critic Walter Allen wrote
positively about my first novel.
In Nigeria there was a mixed bag of responses. Some of my old teachers at
Ibadan found the idea of my publishing a novel “charming,” but many African
intellectuals saw both literary and political merit in the work.
When I wrote Things Fall Apart I began to understand and value my
traditional Igbo history even more. I am not suggesting that I was an expert in
the history of the world. I was a very young man. I knew I had a story, but how it
fit into the story of the world—I really had no sense of that. After a while I
began to understand why the book had resonance. Its meaning for my Igbo
people was clear to me, but I didn’t know how other people elsewhere would
respond to it. Did it have any meaning or relevance for them? I realized that it
did when, to give just one example, the whole class of a girls’ college in South
Korea wrote to me, and each one expressed an opinion about the book. And then
I learned something: They had a history that was similar to the story of Things
Fall Apart—the history of colonization. This I didn’t know before. Their
colonizer was Japan. So these people across the waters were able to relate to the
story of dispossession in Africa. People from different parts of the world can
respond to the same story if it says something to them about their own history
and their own experience.4

A Lucky Generation
It has often been said that my generation was a very lucky one. And I agree. My
luck was actually quite extraordinary. And it began quite early. The pace of
change in Nigeria from the 1940s was incredible. I am not just talking about the
rate of development, with villages transforming into towns, or the coming of
modern comforts, such as electricity or running water or modes of
transportation, but more of a sense that we were standing figuratively and
literally at the dawn of a new era.
My generation was summoned, as it were, to bear witness to two remarkable
transitions—the first the aforementioned impressive economic, social, and
political transformation of Nigeria into a midrange country, at least by third
world standards. But, more profoundly, barely two decades later we were thrust
into the throes of perhaps Nigeria’s greatest twentieth-century moment—our
elevation from a colonized country to an independent nation.

The March to Independence
The general feeling in the air as independence approached was extraordinary,
like the building anticipation of the relief of torrential rains after a season of
scorching hot Harmattan winds and bush fires. We were all looking forward to
feeling the joy that India—the great jewel of the British Empire—must have felt
in 1948, the joy that Ghana must have felt years later, in 1957.
We had no doubt where we were going. We were going to inherit freedom—
that was all that mattered. The possibilities for us were endless, at least so it
seemed at the time. Nigeria was enveloped by a certain assurance of an
unbridled destiny, of an overwhelming excitement about life’s promise,
unburdened by any knowledge of providence’s intended destination.
Ghana was a particularly relevant example for us subjects in the remaining
colonies and dominions of the British Empire. There was a growing confidence,
not just a feeling, that we would do just as well parting ways with Her Majesty’s
empire. If Ghana seemed more effective, as some of our people like to say,
perhaps it was because she was smaller in size and neat, as if it was tied together
more delicately by well-groomed, expert hands.
So we had in 1957 an extraordinary event. I remember it vividly. It was not a
Nigerian event. Ghana is three hundred or more miles away from us, but we saw
her success as ours as well. I remember celebrating with Ghanaian and Nigerian
friends in Lagos all night on the eve of Ghana’s independence from Britain,
ecstatic for our fellow Africans, only to wake up the next morning to find that
we were still in Nigeria. Ghana had made it, leaving us all behind. But our day
came, finally, three years after hers.
Now let it be said: There was a subtle competition between the two
countries. There was a sense in which one could say that Ghana and Nigeria
resented each other and competed for supremacy in every sphere—politics,
academia, sports, you name it. It is possible that Nigerians were less accurate in
thinking of our “rival neighbor” as being perhaps “too small to matter.” Of
course Ghanaians came right back by saying that “Nigeria is bigger than Ghana
in the way in which threepence was bigger than sixpence.” If one were to look at
the various denominations of coins in those days, one would discover that three-

pence was very huge, much larger than sixpence, and the quality of metal used in
making the smaller denomination was clearly of inferior value and had less
purchasing power in the marketplace, where it mattered most. So the relationship
between Ghana and Nigeria has always been very important. Ghanaian
nationalists were heavily influenced by their Nigerian counterparts.

The father of African independence was Nnamdi Azikiwe. There is no question
at all about that. Azikiwe, fondly referred to by his admirers as “Zik,” was the
preeminent political figure of my youth1 and a man who was endowed with the
political pan-Africanist vision. He had help, no doubt, from several eminent sons
and daughters of the soil.
When Azikiwe came back from his university studies in the United States of
America, in 1934 or thereabout, he did not return to Onitsha, his hometown. He
settled at first in Accra, in the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana), where he worked
as the editor of the African Morning Post, a new daily newspaper. There were
stories of inter-ethnic friction in the Gold Coast, so he moved to Lagos. Despite
initial problems in Ghana, Azikiwe had acquired admirers, especially young
aspiring freedom fighters, including Kwame Nkrumah, the greatest of them all.
Nkrumah was still a student in Ghana, but he was motivated to go to America to
study largely as a result of Azikiwe’s influence. Zik opened the historically black
college in the United States that he attended—Lincoln University—to other West
Africans and Nigerians. Quite a number of young Africans who left the country
for America did so because of Azikiwe. It didn’t hurt that Azikiwe wrote
glowingly about America in his newspaper articles on almost a daily basis.
America, you see, seemed to a number of those young people to provide an
escape from the chains of colonialism.2
Soon after Azikiwe arrived in Lagos he established his own paper, The West
African Pilot. At this time there were two or three families of newspapers:
Azikiwe’s and an even older group from Freetown, Sierra Leone; The Accra
Herald from the Gold Coast; The Anglo African; Iwe Ihorin (a prominent Yoruba
newspaper) in Lagos; and Herbert Macauley’s The Daily News. These
newspapers had different traditions. There used to be a joke about the quality of
newspapers that were founded by aristocratic Lagosians.3 Some of these papers
went out of their way to be highbrow; it was said that occasionally large chunks
of the editorials of some were written in Latin.

In contrast to his competition Azikiwe’s newspaper was written in
accessible, stripped-down English—the type of prose educated members of
society often snickered at. And that was Azikiwe’s intention, to speak directly to
the masses. His strategy was an incredible success. The West African Pilot’s
anticolonial message was spread very quickly, widely, and effectively. From the
time of its establishment through the 1940s and 1950s, The West African Pilot
was the most influential publication of its type throughout British West Africa—
from Sierra Leone through Ghana to Nigeria.
Azikiwe wanted to remain financially autonomous from the British, so he
established the African Continental Bank in 1944 and invited wealthy and
influential Nigerians such as Sir Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu to join the board.
Azikiwe also started newspaper outposts in Lagos, Ibadan, Kano, Port Harcourt,
and the market town of Onitsha. I remember in particular that traders in Onitsha
and other markets throughout Nigeria relished The West African Pilot’s daily
political analysis and editorials. Many learned to read with the help of The Pilot.
The traders, in their eagerness to read Azikiwe’s paper, often ignored earlymorning customers who visted their stalls.
The West African Pilot served other purposes. It became the nurturing ground
for top journalistic and future political talent. Anthony Enahoro, who became the
paper’s editor, and Akinola Lasekan, the legendary political cartoonist, are just
two examples that come to mind. The West African Pilot enjoyed an exponential
level of commercial as well as critical success after it supported striking
Nigerian workers against the British government in the 1940s. Its circulation was
in the tens of thousands. That was an outstanding achievement for its time.4

The Cradle of Nigerian Nationalism
Here is a piece of heresy: The British governed their colony of Nigeria with
considerable care. There was a very highly competent cadre of government
officials imbued with a high level of knowledge of how to run a country. This
was not something that the British achieved only in Nigeria; they were able to
manage this on a bigger scale in India and Australia. The British had the
experience of governing and doing it competently. I am not justifying
colonialism. But it is important to face the fact that British colonies, more or
less, were expertly run.
There was a distinct order during this time. I recall the day I traveled from
Lagos to Ibadan and stayed with Christopher Okigbo that evening. I took off
again the next morning, driving alone, going all the way from Lagos to Asaba,
crossing the River Niger, to visit my relatives in the east. That was how it was
done in those days. One was not consumed by fear of abduction or armed
robbery. There was a certain preparation that the British had undertaken in her
colonies. So as the handover time came, it was done with great precision.
As we praise the British, let us also remember the Nigerian nationalists—
those who had a burning desire for independence and fought for it. There was a
body of young and old people that my parents’ generation admired greatly, and
that we later learned about and deeply appreciated. Herbert Macauley, for
instance, often referred to as “the father of Nigerian nationalism,”1 was a very
distinguished Nigerian born during the nineteenth century and the first president
of the Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP), which was founded in
1922.2
The dawn of World War II caused a bit of a lull in the organized
independence struggles that had been centered mainly in the Western Region of
the country up to that time. Across the River Niger, in Eastern Nigeria, I was
entering my teenage years, bright-eyed and beginning to grapple with my
colonial environment. At this time most of the world’s attention, including
Nigeria’s, was turned to the war. Schools and other institutions were converted
into makeshift camps for soldiers from the empire, and there was a great deal of
local military recruitment. A number of my relatives quickly volunteered their

services to His Majesty’s regiments. The colonies became increasingly important
to Great Britain’s war effort by providing a steady stream of revenue from the
export of agricultural products—palm oil, groundnuts, cocoa, rubber, etc. I
remember hearing stories of valiant fighting by a number of African soldiers in
faraway places, such as Abyssinia (today’s Ethiopia), North Africa, and Burma
(today’s Myanmar).3
The postwar era saw an explosion of political organization. Newspapers,
newsreels, and radio programs were full of the exploits of Nnamdi Azikiwe and
the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC, which later became
the National Council of Nigerian Citizens) that was founded in 1944. Azikiwe
built upon lessons he had learned from earlier forays in political activism and
successfully persuaded several active members of the Nigerian Youth Movement
to form an umbrella group of all the major Nigerian organizations.
By the time I became a young adult, Obafemi Awolowo had emerged as one
of Nigeria’s dominant political figures. He was an erudite and accomplished
lawyer who had been educated at the University of London. When he returned to
the Nigerian political scene from England in 1947, Awolowo found the once
powerful political establishment of western Nigeria in disarray—sidetracked by
partisan and intra-ethnic squabbles. Chief Awolowo and close associates reunited
his ancient Yoruba people with powerful glue—resuscitated ethnic pride—and
created a political party, the Action Group, in 1951, from an amalgamation of the
Egbe Omo Oduduwa, the Nigerian Produce Traders’ Association, and a few
other factions.4
Over the years Awolowo had become increasingly concerned about what he
saw as the domination of the NCNC by the Igbo elite, led by Azikiwe. Some
cynics believe the formation of the Action Group was not influenced by tribal
loyalities but a purely tactical political move to regain regional and southern
political power and influence from the dominant NCNC.
Initially Chief Obafemi Awolowo struggled to woo support from the Ibadanbased (and other non-Ijebu) Yoruba leaders who considered him a radical and a
bit of an upstart. However, despite some initial difficulty, Awolowo transformed
the Action Group into a formidable, highly disciplined political machine that
often outperformed the NCNC in regional elections. It did so by meticulously
galvanizing political support in Yoruba land and among the riverine and minority
groups in the Niger Delta who shared a similar dread of the prospects of Igbo
political domination.5
When Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto,6 decided to create the

Northern People’s Congress (NPC) in the late 1940s, he knew that the
educationally disadvantaged North did not have as rich a source of Westerneducated politicians to choose from as the South did. He overcame this
“shortcoming” by pulling together an assortment of leaders from the Islamic
territories under his influence and a few Western-educated intellectuals—the
most prominent in my opinion being Aminu Kano and Alhaji Tafewa Balewa,
Nigeria’s first prime minister. Frustrated by what he saw as “Ahmadu Bello’s
limited political vision,”7 the incomparable Aminu Kano, under whom I would
serve as the deputy national president of the Peoples Redemption Party decades
later, would leave the NPC in 1950 to form the left-of-center political party, the
Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU).8
Sir Ahmadu Bello was a schoolteacher by training. He was a contentious and
ardently ambitious figure who claimed direct lineage from one of the founders of
the Islamic Sokoto Caliphate—Shehu Usman dan Fodio. It was also widely
known that he had “aspired to the throne of the Sultan of Sokoto.” By
midcentury, through brilliant political maneuvering among the northern ruling
classes, Sir Ahmadu Bello emerged as the most powerful politician in the
Northern Region, indeed in all of Nigeria.
Sir Ahmadu Bello was able to control northern Nigeria politically by feeding
on the fears of the ruling emirs and a small elite group of Western-educated
northerners. His ever-effective mantra was that in order to protect the mainly
feudal North’s hegemonic interests it was critical to form a political party
capable of resisting the growing power of Southern politicians.
Ahmadu Bello and his henchmen shared little in terms of ideological or
political aspirations with their southern counterparts. With the South split
between Azikiwe’s National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC) and
Awolowo’s Action Group, his ability to hold the North together meant that the
NPC in essence became Nigeria’s ruling party. A testament to its success is the
fact that the NPC later would not only hold the majority of seats in the postindependence parliament, but as a consequence would be called upon to name
the first prime minister of Nigeria.9

—
The minorities of the Niger Delta, Mid-West, and the Middle Belt regions of
Nigeria were always uncomfortable with the notion that they had to fit into the
tripod of the largest ethnic groups that was Nigeria—Hausa/Fulani, Yoruba, and

Igbo. Many of them—Ijaw, Kanuri, Ibibio, Tiv, Itsekiri, Isang, Urhobo, Anang,
and Efik—were from ancient nation-states in their own right. Their leaders,
however, often had to subsume their own ethnic ambitions within alliances with
one of the big three groups in order to attain greater political results.
The British were well aware of the inter-ethnic tensions and posturing for
power among the three main ethnic groups. By 1951 they had divided the
country into the Northern, Eastern, and Western Regions, with their own
respective houses of assembly, to contain this rising threat.10 There was also
what many thought was an inane house of chiefs—a poor copy of the House of
Lords of the British Parliament. Clear-eyed pundits saw this mainly as a political
ploy to appease the Northerners and Westerners who wanted their traditional
rulers to play a greater role in Nigerian affairs.
Initially the British resisted any agitations for independence, often by
handing out stiff jail terms for “sedition” to the “disturbers of the peace.” They
knew the value of their colonies, and the natural resources they possessed—in
Nigeria’s case oil, coal, gold, tin, columbite, cocoa, palm oil, groundnuts, and
rubber, as well as the immense human resources and intellectual capital. Surely
Great Britain had no plans to hand all these riches over without a fight.
Over time, however, it became clear to the colonizers that they were engaged
in a losing battle. By the end of World War II Great Britain was financially and
politically exhausted. This weakness was exploited by Mohandas Gandhi and his
cohorts in India during their own struggle against British rule. Nigerian veterans
from different theaters of the war had acquired certain skills—important military
expertise in organization, movement, strategy, and combat—during their service
to the king. Another proficiency that came naturally to this group was the skill of
protest, which was quickly absorbed by the Nigerian nationalists.

Post-Independence Nigeria
By the late 1950s the British were rapidly accepting the inevitability of
independence coming to one of their major colonies, Nigeria. Officers began to
retire and return home to England, vacating their positions in Nigeria’s colonial
government. They left in droves, quietly, amiably, often at night, mainly on
ships, but also, particularly the wealthier ones, on planes. The British clearly had
a well-thought-out exit strategy, with handover plans in place long before we
noticed.
Literally all government ministries, public and privately held firms,
corporations, organizations, and schools saw the majority of their expatriate staff
leave. Not everyone left, however; some, particularly in the commercial sector
and the oil businesses, stayed. The civilized behavior of their brethren made this
an acceptable development.
While this quiet transition was happening a number of internal jobs,
especially the senior management positions, began to open up for Nigerians,
particularly for those with a university education. It was into these positions
vacated by the British that a number of people like myself were placed—a
daunting, exhilarating inheritance that was not without its anxieties. Most of us
felt well prepared, because we had received an outstanding education. This is not
to say that there were not those racked with doubt, and sometimes outright
dread. There were. But most of us were ready to take destiny in our own hands,
and for a while at least, it worked quite well.
This “bequest” was much greater than just stepping into jobs left behind by
the British. Members of my generation also moved into homes in the former
British quarters previously occupied by members of the European senior civil
service. These homes often came with servants—chauffeurs, maids, cooks,
gardeners, stewards—whom the British had organized meticulously to “ease
their colonial sojourn.” Now following the departure of the Europeans, many
domestic staff stayed in the same positions and were only too grateful to
continue their designated salaried roles in post-independence Nigeria. Their
masters were no longer European but their own brothers and sisters. This
bequest continued in the form of new club memberships and access to previously

all-white areas of town, restaurants, and theaters.

—
This account about the handover of power I have just provided is perhaps too
wonderful to be absolutely true. History teaches us that people who have been
oppressed—this is the language of the freedom fight, and it was a fight—are
often too ready to let bygones be bygones. Clearly it was more complicated than
that; it was a long struggle. Having said that, I think most who were there would
admit that when the moment came, it was handled quite well.
One example that I will give to illustrate the complexity of that moment of
transition occurred at the very highest level of government. When Britain
decided to hand over power to Nigeria, they also decided to change the governor
general. They brought a new governor general from the Sudan, Sir James
Robertson, to take the reins in Nigeria. Now that Independence Day was
approaching a number of onlookers were wondering why there was a new
posting from Britain, and no provision made for a Nigerian successor. It became
clear that Sir James was going to be there on Independence Day and, as it turned
out, wanted to stay on as governor general for a whole year into the period of
freedom. One wondered how he was going to leave. Would it be in disgrace?
Would he be hiding, or something of the sort?
It is now widely known that Sir James Robertson played an important role in
overseeing the elections (or lack thereof) at independence, throwing his weight
behind Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, who had been tapped to become Nigeria’s first
prime minister.
I remember hearing Azikiwe comment years later on those events. He was
asked in a small gathering: “Why did Sir James Robertson not go home, like the
other people who were leaving?”
Azikiwe made light of the question: “Well, when he told me that he was
going to stay on, I said to him, Go on, stay as long as you like.” The laughter that
followed did not obscure the greater meaning of his statement.

—
Later it was discovered that a courageous English junior civil servant named
Harold Smith had been selected by no other than Sir James Robertson to oversee
the rigging of Nigeria’s first election “so that its compliant friends in [Northern

Nigeria] would win power, dominate the country, and serve British interests after
independence.” Despite the enticements of riches and bribes (even a knighthood,
we are told), Smith refused to be part of this elaborate hoax to fix Nigeria’s
elections, and he swiftly became one of the casualties of this mischief. Smith’s
decision was a bold choice that cost him his job, career, and reputation (at least
until recently).1
In a sense, Nigerian independence came with a British governor general in
command, and, one might say, popular faith in genuine democracy was
compromised from its birth.

The Decline
Within six years of this tragic colonial manipulation Nigeria was a cesspool of
corruption and misrule. Public servants helped themselves freely to the nation’s
wealth. Elections were blatantly rigged. The subsequent national census was
outrageously stage-managed; judges and magistrates were manipulated by the
politicians in power. The politicians themselves were pawns of foreign business
interests.1
The social malaise in Nigerian society was political corruption. The structure
of the country was such that there was an inbuilt power struggle among the
ethnic groups, and of course those who were in power wanted to stay in power.
The easiest and simplest way to retain it, even in a limited area, was to appeal to
tribal sentiments, so they were egregiously exploited in the 1950s and 1960s.
The original idea of one Nigeria was pressed by the leaders and intellectuals
from the Eastern Region. With all their shortcomings, they had this idea to build
the country as one. The first to object were the Northerners, led by the Sardauna,
who were followed closely by the Awolowo clique that had created the Action
Group. The Northern Peoples Congress of the Sardaunians was supposed to be a
national party, yet it refused to change its name from Northern to Nigerian
Peoples Congress, even for the sake of appearances. It refused right up to the end
of the civilian regime.
The prime minister of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, who had been
built up into a great statesman by the Western world, did nothing to save his
country from impending chaos. The British made certain on the eve of their
departure that power went to that conservative element in the country that had
played no real part in the struggle for independence. This was the situation in
which I wrote my novel A Man of the People.
Nigerian artists responded to these events in a variety of ways. The
irrepressible Wole Soyinka put on the stage a devastating satire, Before the
Blackout, which played to packed houses night after night in Ibadan. The
popular traveling theater of Hubert Ogunde and his many wives began to stage a
play clearly directed against the crooked premier of Western Nigeria. The theater
group was declared an unlawful society and banned in Western Nigeria. Things

were coming to a head in that region. Violence erupted after an unbelievable
election swindle, as a result of the anger and frustration of Western Nigerians. It
was in these circumstances that Wole Soyinka was charged with holding up the
Ibadan radio station and removing the premier’s taped speech!
Creative writers in independent Nigeria found themselves with a new,
terrifying problem on their hands: They found that the independence their
country was supposed to have won was totally without content. In the words of
Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria was given her freedom “on a platter of gold.” We
should have known that freedom should be won, not given on a plate. Like the
head of John the Baptist, this gift to Nigeria proved most unlucky.

The Role of the Writer in Africa
What then were we to do as writers? What was our role in our new country?
How were we to think about the use of our talents? I can say that when a number
of us decided that we would be writers, we had not thought through these
questions very clearly. In fact, we did not have a clue what we were up against.
What I can say is that it was clear to many of us that an indigenous African
literary renaissance was overdue. A major objective was to challenge
stereotypes, myths, and the image of ourselves and our continent, and to recast
them through stories—prose, poetry, essays, and books for our children. That
was my overall goal.
When a number of us decided to pick up the pen and make writing a career
there was no African literature as we know it today. There were of course our
great oral tradition—the epics of the Malinke, the Bamana, and the Fulani—the
narratives of Olaudah Equaino, works by D. A. Fagunwa and Muhammadu
Bello, and novels by Pita Nwana, Amos Tutuola, and Cyprian Ekwensi.
Across the African continent, literary aficionados could savor the works of
Egyptian, Nubian, and Carthaginian antiquity; Amharic and Tigrigna writings
from Ethiopia and Eritrea; and the magnificent poetry and creation myths of
Somalia. There was more—the breathtakingly beautiful Swahili poetry of East
and Central Africa, and the chronicles, legends, and fables of the Ashanti,
Dogon, Hutu, Kalanga, Mandingo, Ndebele, Ovambo, Shona, Sotho, Swazi,
Tsonga, Tswana, Tutsi, Venda, Wolof, Xhosa, and Zulu.
Olive Schreiner’s nineteenth-century classic Story of an African Farm and
works by Samuel Mqhayi and Thomas Mofolo, Alan Paton, Camara Laye,
Mongo Beti, Peter Abrahams, and Ferdinand Oyono, all preceded our time. Still,
the numbers were not sufficient.1
And so I had no idea when I was writing Things Fall Apart whether it would
even be accepted or published. All of this was new—there was nothing by which
I could gauge how it was going to be received.
Writing has always been a serious business for me. I felt it was a moral
obligation. A major concern of the time was the absence of the African voice.
Being part of that dialogue meant not only sitting at the table but effectively

telling the African story from an African perspective—in full earshot of the
world.
The preparation for this life of writing, I have mentioned, came from
English-system-style schools and university. I read Shakespeare, Dickens, and
all the books that were read in the English public schools. They were novels and
poems about English culture, and some things I didn’t know anything about.
When I saw a good sentence, saw a good phrase from the Western canon, of
course I was influenced by it. But the story itself—there weren’t any models.
Those that were set in Africa were not particularly inspiring. If they were not
saying something that was antagonistic toward us, they weren’t concerned about
us.
When people talk about African culture they often mean an assortment of
ancient customs and traditions. The reasons for this view are quite clear. When
the first Europeans came to Africa they knew very little of the history and
complexity of the people and the continent. Some of that group persuaded
themselves that Africa had no culture, no religion, and no history. It was a
convenient conclusion, because it opened the door for all sorts of rationalizations
for the exploitation that followed. Africa was bound, sooner or later, to respond
to this denigration by resisting and displaying her own accomplishments. To do
this effectively her spokesmen—the writers, intellectuals, and some politicians,
including Azikiwe, Senghor, Nkrumah, Nyerere, Lumumba, and Mandela—
engaged Africa’s past, stepping back into what can be referred to as the “era of
purity,” before the coming of Europe. We put into the books and poems what
was uncovered there, and this became known as African culture.
This was a very special kind of inspiration. Some of us decided to tackle the
big subjects of the day—imperialism, slavery, independence, gender, racism, etc.
And some did not. One could write about roses or the air or about love for all I
cared; that was fine too. As for me, however, I chose the former.
Engaging such heavy subjects while at the same time trying to help create a
unique and authentic African literary tradition would mean that some of us
would decide to use the colonizer’s tools: his language, altered sufficiently to
bear the weight of an African creative aesthetic, infused with elements of the
African literary tradition. I borrowed proverbs from our culture and history,
colloquialisms and African expressive language from the ancient griots, the
worldviews, perspectives, and customs from my Igbo tradition and cosmology,
and the sensibilities of everyday people.
It was important to us that a body of work be developed of the highest

possible quality that would oppose the negative discourse in some of the novels
we encountered. By “writing back” to the West we were attempting to reshape
the dialogue between the colonized and the colonizer. Our efforts, we hoped,
would broaden the world’s understanding, appreciation, and conceptualization of
what literature meant when including the African voice and perspective.2 We
were clearly engaged in what Ode Ogede aptly refers to as “the politics of
representation.”3
This is another way of stating the fact of what I consider to be my mission in
life. My kind of storytelling has to add its voice to this universal storytelling
before we can say, “Now we’ve heard it all.” I worry when somebody from one
particular tradition stands up and says, “The novel is dead, the story is dead.” I
find this to be unfair, to put it mildly. You told your own story, and now you’re
announcing the novel is dead. Well, I haven’t told mine yet.4
There are some who believe that the writer has no role in politics or the
social upheavals of his or her day. Some of my friends say, “No, it is too rough
there. A writer has no business being where it is so rough. The writer should be
on the sidelines with his notepad and pen, where he can observe with
objectivity.” I believe that the African writer who steps aside can only write
footnotes or a glossary when the event is over. He or she will become like the
contemporary intellectual of futility in many other places, asking questions like:
“Who am I? What is the meaning of my existence? Does this place belong to me
or to someone else? Does my life belong to me or to some other person?” These
are questions that no one can answer.
Ali Mazrui famously restated this position in his novel The Trial of
Christopher Okigbo in which he takes my friend, the great poet, to task for, as
Mazrui believes, “wasting his great talent on a conflict of disputable merit: ‘The
Nigerian Civil War and all its ramified implications [can be] compressed in the
single poetic tragedy of the death of Christopher Okigbo.’”5 In Mazrui’s fiction
Christopher Okigbo finds himself charged with “the offence of putting society
before art in his scale of values. . . . No great artist has a right to carry patriotism
to the extent of destroying his creative potential.”6
Christopher Okigbo believed, as I do, that art and community in Africa are
clearly linked. African art as we understand it has not been distilled or purified
and refined to the point where it has lost all traces of real life, lost the vitality of
the street, like art from some advanced societies and academic art tend to be. In
Africa the tendency is to keep art involved with the people. It is clearly
emphasized among my own Igbo people that art must never be allowed to escape

into the rarefied atmosphere but must remain active in the lives of the members
of society.
I have described earlier the practice of mbari, the Igbo concept of “art as
celebration.” Different aspects of Igbo life are integrated in this art form. Even
those who are not trained artists are brought in to participate in these artistic
festivals, in which the whole life of the world is depicted. Ordinary people must
be brought in; a conscious effort must be made to bring the life of the village or
town into this art. The Igbo culture says no condition is permanent. There is
constant change in the world. Foreign visitors who had not been encountered up
to that time are brought in as well, to illustrate the dynamic nature of life. The
point I’m trying to make is that there is a need to bring life back into art by
bringing art into life, so that the two can hold a conversation.
In a novel such as Amos Tutuola’s The Palm-Wine Drinkard you can see this
vitality put to work on the written page. There is no attempt to draw a line
between what is permissible and what is not, what is possible and what is not
possible, what is new and what is old. In a story that is set in the distant past you
suddenly see a telephone, a car, a bishop—all kinds of things that don’t seem to
tie in. But in fact what you have is the whole life of the community, not just the
community of humans but the community of ancestors, the animal world, of
trees, and so on. Everything plays a part.

—
My own assessment is that the role of the writer is not a rigid position and
depends to some extent on the state of health of his or her society. In other
words, if a society is ill the writer has a responsibility to point it out. If the
society is healthier, the writer’s job is different.
We established the Society of Nigerian Authors (SONA) in the mid-1960s as
an attempt to put our writers in a firm and dynamic frame. It was sort of a trade
union. We thought it would keep our members safe and protect other artists as
well. We hoped that our existence would create an environment in Nigeria where
freedom of creative expression was not only possible but protected. We sought
ultimately through our art to create for Nigeria an environment of good order
and civilization—a daunting task that needed to be tackled in a country engulfed
in crisis.
The notion of beneficent fiction is simply one of defining storytelling as a
creative component of human experience, human life. It is something griots have

done in Africa from the dawn of time—pass down stories that have a positive
purpose and a use for society, from generation to generation. Some people flinch
when you talk about art in the context of the needs of society, thinking you are
introducing something far too common for a discussion of art. Why should art
have a purpose and a use? Art shouldn’t be concerned with purpose and reason
and need, they say. These are improper. But from the very beginning, it seems to
me, stories have indeed been meant to be enjoyed, to appeal to that part of us
which enjoys good form and good shape and good sound. Still I think that
behind it all is a desire to make our experience in the world better, to make our
passage through life easier. Once you talk about making things better you’re
talking about politics.
I believe that it is impossible to write anything in Africa without some kind
of commitment, some kind of message, some kind of protest. In my definition I
am a protest writer, with restraint. Even those early novels that look like very
gentle re-creations of the past—what they were saying, in effect, was that we had
a past. That was the protest, because there were people who thought we didn’t
have a past. What I was doing was to say politely that we did—here it is. So
commitment is nothing new. Commitment runs through my work. In fact, I
should say that all of our writers, whether they’re aware of it or not, are
committed writers. The whole pattern of life demanded that one should protest,
that you should put in a word for your history, your traditions, your religion, and
so on.7 The question of involvement in politics is really a matter of definition. I
think it is quite often misunderstood. I have never proposed that every artist
become an activist in the way we have always understood political activity.
Some will, because that’s the way they are. Others will not, and we must not ask
anyone to do more than is necessary for them to perform their task.
At the same time it is important to state that words have the power to hurt,
even to denigrate and oppress others. Before I am accused of prescribing a way
in which a writer should write, let me say that I do think that decency and
civilization would insist that the writer take sides with the powerless. Clearly
there is no moral obligation to write in any particular way. But there is a moral
obligation, I think, not to ally oneself with power against the powerless. An
artist, in my definition of the word, would not be someone who takes sides with
the emperor against his powerless subjects.8 If one didn’t realize the world was
complex, vast, and diverse, one would write as if the world were one little
county, and this would make us poor, and we would have impoverished the
novel and our stories.

The reality of today, different as it is from the reality of my society one
hundred years ago, is and can be important if we have the energy and the
inclination to challenge it, to go out and engage with its peculiarities, with the
things that we do not understand. The real danger is the tendency to retreat into
the obvious, the tendency to be frightened by the richness of the world and to
clutch what we always have understood. The writer is often faced with two
choices—turn away from the reality of life’s intimidating complexity or conquer
its mystery by battling with it. The writer who chooses the former soon runs out
of energy and produces elegantly tired fiction.9
The Igbo believe that art, religion, everything, the whole of life are embodied
in the art of the masquerade. It is dynamic. It is not allowed to remain stationary.
For instance, museums are unknown among the Igbo people. They do not even
contemplate the idea of having something like a canon with the postulate: “This
is how this sculpture should be made, and once it’s made it should be venerated.”
No, the Igbo people want to create these things again and again, and every
generation has a chance to execute its own model of art. So there’s no undue
respect for what the last generation did, because if you do that too much it means
that there is no need for me to do anything, because it’s already been done.10

—
One thing that I find a little worrying, though, is the suggestion that perhaps
what was done in the 1960s, when African literature suddenly came into its own,
was not as revolutionary as we make it out to be. That African literature without
a concerted effort on the part of the writers of that era would still have found its
voice. You find the same kind of cynicism among young African Americans who
occasionally dismiss the contributions of the civil rights activists of that same
period. Many of these same critics clearly did not know (or maybe do not want
to be told) what Africa was like in the 1940s, back when there was no significant
literature at all.
There are people who do not realize that it was a different world than the
world of today, one which is far more open. This openness and the opportunities
that abound for a young intellectual setting out to carve a writing career for himor herself are in fact partly a result of the work of that literature, the struggles of
that era. So even though nobody is asking the new writer or intellectual to repeat
the stories, the literary agenda or struggles of yesteryear, it is very important for
them to be aware of what our literature achieved, what it has done for us, so that

we can move forward.
As I write this I am aware that there are people, many friends of mine, who
feel that there are too many cultures around. In fact, I heard someone say that
they think some of these cultures should be put down, that there are just too
many. We did not make the world, so there is no reason we should be quarreling
with the number of cultures there are. If any group decides on its own that its
culture is not worth talking about, it can stop talking about it. But I don’t think
anybody can suggest to another person, Please drop your culture; let’s use mine.
That’s the height of arrogance and the boast of imperialism. I think cultures
know how to fight their battles; cultures know how to struggle. It is up to the
owners of any particular culture to ensure it survives, or if they don’t want it to
survive, they should act accordingly, but I am not going to recommend that.
My position, therefore, is that we must hear all the stories. That would be the
first thing. And by hearing all the stories we will find points of contact and
communication, and the world story, the Great Story, will have a chance to
develop. That’s the only precaution I would suggest—that we not rush into
announcing the arrival of this international, this great world story, based simply
on our knowledge of one or a few traditions. For instance, in America there is
really very little knowledge of the literature of the rest of the world. Of the
literature of Latin America, yes. But that’s not all that different in inspiration
from that of America, or of Europe. One must go further. You don’t even have to
go too far in terms of geography—you can start with the Native Americans and
listen to their poetry.

—
Most writers who are beginners, if they are honest with themselves, will admit
that they are praying for a readership as they begin to write. But it should be the
quality of the craft, not the audience, that should be the greatest motivating
factor. For me, at least, I can declare that when I wrote Things Fall Apart I
couldn’t have told anyone the day before it was accepted for publication that
anybody was going to read it. There was no guarantee; nobody ever said to me,
Go and write this, we will publish it, and we will read it; it was just there. But
my brother-in-law, who was not a particularly voracious reader, told me that he
read the novel through the night and it gave him a terrible headache the next
morning. And I took that as an encouraging endorsement!11
The triumph of the written word is often attained when the writer achieves

union and trust with the reader, who then becomes ready to be drawn deep into
unfamiliar territory, walking in borrowed literary shoes so to speak, toward a
deeper understanding of self or society, or of foreign peoples, cultures, and
situations.12

January 15, 1966, Coup
On Saturday, January 15, 1966, a pivotal day in the history of Nigeria, members
of the Society of Nigerian Authors happened to be gathered for a meeting. The
venue was an office building on Kingsway Road in Ikoyi, Lagos. There were
about ten of us living in Lagos at the time: John Pepper Clark-Bekederemo (aka
J. P. Clark), Wole Soyinka, Onuora Nzekwu, and a few others. A few members
were sitting at a table that looked out onto the Lagos Lagoon. We were engaged
in polite conversation, delaying the start of the meeting as some of our members
trickled in.
It happened that my new novel, A Man of the People, was about to be
published in London, and I was communicating with my publisher, Heinemann. I
knew that the book was going to be problematic for me because of its criticism
of Nigerian politics—very severe criticism. The novel, after all, climaxes in a
military coup.
I had sent one copy of the novel to J. P. Clark on a Wednesday, two days
earlier. When J.P. arrived at the meeting his voice rang out from several hundred
feet away.
“Chinua, you know, you are a prophet. Everything in this book has happened
except a coup!”
That very evening, unbeknownst to us, a military coup was being launched
that would change Nigeria forever.
The next day I got a message from Heinemann, a cable or telex, asking me
whether they should go ahead and publish the book. Why would they send this
message? I wondered. I was unaware that a coup had happened the night before.
I told the gentleman who carried this message—I think from the British embassy
—to tell my publisher to go ahead and publish the novel. I was not particularly
afraid, even though I had concerns. I thought, Who was likely to misunderstand?
My sentiment changed from incredulity to dread when we heard details and the
surrounding events of the coup.
In those days we went to work on Saturdays and worked till noon. When I
got to my office that Saturday there were soldiers everywhere, surrounding
Broadcasting House. The soldiers stopped me and interrogated me until they

were satisfied that I worked there, and then let me pass through. The
announcement of a coup on the radio had not been made. Some people had their
suspicions, because soldiers in military vehicles were seen being deployed
throughout the city, and roadblocks with barbed wire were being erected
everywhere.
News began to seep through. We heard that the prime minister was missing.
Then came news from Kaduna that the Sardauna,1 Sir Ahmadu Bello, the most
powerful of the premiers, had been killed. We then heard that Samuel Akintola,
the premier of Western Nigeria, had also been killed. Those of us working in
broadcasting in the coming days would get a more detailed list of those killed,
imprisoned, or detained during the coup. These events thrust Nigeria into a state
of shock for a long time.

—
Nigeria was not ready or willing to face her problems. If her leaders had
approached their duty with humility, they all might have realized long before the
coup that the country was in deep trouble. Nigeria was rocked by one crisis after
another in the years that followed independence. First the Nigerian census crisis
of 1963–64 shook the nation, then the federal election crisis of 1964, which was
followed by the Western Nigeria election crisis of 1965—which threatened to
split the country at its seams. At that point most of us, the writers at least, knew
that something was very wrong in Nigeria. A fix was long overdue.
When the artist’s imagination clashes with life’s very reality it creates a
heavy conundrum. The story Nigeria had of herself was that something like a
military coup would never happen; Nigeria was too stable for that. We were
utterly unprepared for such an event, and for the magnitude of the dislocation
that ensued.
Despite my fictional warning I never expected or wanted the form of violent
intervention that became the military coup of January 15, 1966. I had hoped that
the politicians would sort things out for our new nation. Any confidence we had
that things could be put right was smashed as we watched elements from the
military take control. The coup was led by a group of junior officers, most of
them Igbo, and it would be known widely as the Nzeogwu coup after Major
Chukwuma Nzeogwu, the ringleader, who was from the northern city of Kaduna.
That night of January 15, 1966, is something Nigeria has never really recovered
from.

The Dark Days
On January 16, 1966, the day after the Nzeogwu coup, my wife, Christie, took
our first child, Chinelo, to the movies to catch the matinee. Chinelo was full of
energy—always running all over the place. My wife’s doctor, Dr. Okoronkwo
Ogan, who became our daughter’s godfather, called her “quicksilver.”1 On their
way home, my wife decided to drop by and see me in the office, so that our
daughter could tell me all about the movie they had watched. I believe it was the
Disney classic Dumbo, about the flying elephant. As they approached the
Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation they saw the soldiers around but did not
know what was happening. They were not scared, even though they found the
commotion a bit peculiar.
As they walked to my office someone yelled at my wife: “Where are you
going? Don’t you know what is happening?” So she walked more briskly,
because she wanted to find out whether I was alive. A soldier stopped them and
asked them to leave. They returned home and tuned into the radio station to find
out what was going on.
People were standing on the streets in small groups, listening to the radios of
street newspaper vendors. There had been a coup, the radio announcers said, at
which point there was an initial period of spontaneous, overt jubilation. The
story of the coup and how it happened started leaking out, first from the military
barracks and then from the international media. There was a great deal of anxiety
among the general populace. Everyone wanted to find out exactly what had
happened in Kaduna, Lagos, Ibadan, and elsewhere the night before, though
apparently not much action had been seen in Enugu, the capital of the Eastern
Region. The initial vacuum of information was filled with gossip, innuendo, and
fabricated accounts that magnified the confusion throughout the country. A
second story got around that the military coup, which at first had been so well
received, was in fact a sinister plot by the ambitious Igbos of the East to seize
control of Nigeria.
In a country in which tribalism was endemic, the rumor of an “Igbo coup”
began to find acceptance. Before long many people were persuaded that their
spontaneous jubilation in January had been a mistake. A Nigerian poet who had

dedicated a new book “to the heroes of January 1966” had second thoughts after
the countercoup of July, and he sent a frantic cable to his publishers to remove
the dedication.
Those who knew Nigeria were not very surprised, because part of the way to
respond to confusion in Nigeria is to blame those from the other ethnic group or
the other side of the country. One found some ethnic or religious element
supporting whatever one was trying to make sense of. This angle grew stronger
and stronger as the days passed, mainly because the state of confusion was not
really dispelled satisfactorily by the authorities.
The weeks following the coup saw Easterners attacked both randomly and in
an organized fashion. There seemed to be a lust for revenge, which meant an
excuse for Nigerians to take out their resentment on the Igbos who led the nation
in virtually every sector—politics, education, commerce, and the arts. This
group, the Igbo, that gave the colonizing British so many headaches and then
literally drove them out of Nigeria was now an open target, scapegoats for the
failings and grievances of colonial and post-independence Nigeria.
It was a desperate time. Soldiers were being used by elements in power to
commit a number of crimes against Igbos, Nigerian citizens. Military officers
were rounding people up and summarily executing them, particularly in the
North, we were told by victims fleeing the pogroms. There was a story of
hoodlums looking to hunt down and kill Dr. Okechukwu Ikejiani, who was the
chairman of the Nigerian Coal Corporation.2 Dr. Ikejiani escaped the grasp of
these thugs by dressing up as a woman and crossing the Nigeria border to
Dahomey (today’s Republic of Benin)!
In Lagos, where we lived, soldiers were also used in targeted raids of certain
people’s homes, including our own. It happened that my wife and I had moved
recently from Milverton Street to Turnbull Road, after my promotion to director
of external broadcasting. Fortunately for us the soldiers went to Milverton Street,
to our old house, to search for me.
Some may wonder why soldiers would be after me so fervently. As I
mentioned, it happened that I had just written A Man of the People, which
forecast a military coup that overthrows a corrupt civilian government. Clearly a
case of fact imitating fiction and nothing else, but some military leaders believed
that I must have had something to do with the coup and wanted to bring me in
for questioning.
Eventually my family and I left our Turnbull Road house, a painful decision.
We had moved into it after we were married. It was located in Ikoyi, a nice

section of town, overlooking the lagoon. I remember receiving important visitors
in our home, such as the great African American poet Langston Hughes, who
stopped by during one of his famous African tours. I have a favorite picture of
the two of us from that period, standing near a palm tree on the lawn of that
lovely residence.
We found refuge in an old friend’s house—Frank Cawson, the British
Council representative in Lagos, whose intervention literally saved our lives. He
housed us for a number of days. Mr. Cawson had been the British Council
representative in Accra, Ghana, and had invited me to give a lecture there before
he came to Lagos. I delivered a lecture, entitled, “The African Writer and the
English Language.” So when Mr. Cawson was transferred to Nigeria, he was
already known to me.
He was monitoring local and international radio and newspapers to get a
sense of what was happening. He took a number of precautionary steps to
enhance our safety. First he took his car out of the garage and put our own there
instead, so that no one would see it. It was a very tense, anxiety-plagued period
for my wife and me and our two children, Chinelo, who was five years old, and
Ike, who was two. Making matters worse was the fact that Frank Cawson was
quite ill—I think with malaria.
For about a week, lying hidden in Mr. Cawson’s house in Lagos, I still
simply thought that things had temporarily gotten out of hand, and that
everything would soon be all right. Then, suddenly, I discovered that I had been
operating on a false and perhaps naïve basis all along. The soldiers located us
after we had been hiding about a week. It became clear to me that I had to send
my family away.
As many of us packed our belongings to return east some of the people we
had lived with for years, some for decades, jeered and said, “Let them [Igbos]
go; food will be cheaper in Lagos.” That kind of experience is very powerful. It
is something I could not possibly forget. I realized suddenly that I had not been
living in my home; I had been living in a strange place. There were more and
more reports of massacres, and not only in the North, but also in the West and in
Lagos. People were hounded out of their homes, as we were in Lagos, and
returned to the East. We expected to hear something from the intellectuals, from
our friends. Rather, what we heard was, “Oh, they had it coming to them,” or
words to that effect. There were many others from other parts of Nigeria who did
not jeer but suffered with us at this sudden discovery that a section of the large,
diverse Nigerian family was not welcome in this new country.

A lot of this hot-blooded anger was fanned by British intellectuals and some
radical Northern elements in places like Ahmadu Bello University. They were
aided by a few in the expatriate population from outside Nigeria, who easily
influenced the mostly self-satisfied and docile Northern leadership to activate a
weapon that has been used repeatedly in Nigeria’s short history—a fringe
element known as “area boys” or the “rent-a-crowd types”—to attack Igbos in an
orgy of blood.
As we reached the brink of full-blown war it became clear to me that the
chaos enveloping all of us in Nigeria was due to the incompetence of the
Nigerian ruling class. They clearly had a poor grasp of history and found it
difficult to appreciate and grapple with Nigeria’s ethnic and political complexity.
This clique, stunted by ineptitude, distracted by power games and the pursuit of
material comforts, was unwilling, if not incapable, of saving our fledgling new
nation.

—
I arranged to smuggle Christie and the children out of Lagos on a cargo ship
from the port. Christie reports that it was one of the most horrendous voyages
she has ever undertaken. She remembers the seasickness heightened on this
particular trip as a result of her pregnancy. She and the children and other
refugees from the bloodshed were placed in a section of the ship that was in the
open, without any shelter from the elements. There was vomiting, nausea; it was
just awful. After the harrowing sea journey, Christie, Chinelo, and Ike were
received safely in Port Harcourt in Eastern Nigeria by her brother, Dr. Samuel
Okoli, an obstetrician-gynecologist, who served gallantly during the war effort.
I found it difficult to come to terms with the fact that Nigeria was
disintegrating, that I had to leave my house, leave Lagos, leave my job. So I
decided to sneak back into our Turnbull Road residence and return to work.
People were disappearing right and left. . . . There was a media report of
someone from the senior service whose body was found the night before. At this
point the killings had reached the peak figure of hundreds a week.
Victor Badejo, the director general of Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation,
saw me on the premises, stopped me, and said, “What are you still doing here?”
And then he said, “Life has no duplicate”3 and provided further clarification of
the situation. Badejo confirmed a story I had heard of drunken soldiers who
came to my office “wanting to find out which was more powerful, their guns or

my pen.” He was quite anxious on my behalf and advised me to leave my
Turnbull Road residence immediately.4
Philip Ume-Ezeoke was the controller of education programming at the
Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. We were both from the Eastern Region and
got on rather well. He and I decided together that the time had come for us to
travel back to the East. Relatives were sending messages from there begging
their loved ones in Lagos to return. There were a number of people like us who
did not really want to see this come about . . . did not believe this was
happening. Ume-Ezeoke came to my house and suggested we go in a two-car
convoy back to Eastern Nigeria. We agreed on a time that we would leave Lagos
the following morning.
I got to Ume-Ezeoke’s house the next morning very early, exactly at the
agreed-upon time, but no one was there. He was already gone. Unfortunately,
Philip Ume-Ezeoke is no longer alive. If he were, it would be interesting to
know what happened. In any case, I set out on my own, wondering what would
come up at any point. The highway was full of police roadblocks along the way.
I was stopped once or twice and had to show my papers—what Nigerians call
my “particulars.”

—
I was one of the last to flee Lagos. I simply could not bring myself to accept that
I could no longer live in my nation’s capital, although the facts clearly said so.
My feeling toward Nigeria was one of profound disappointment. Not only
because mobs were hunting down and killing innocent civilians in many parts,
especially in the North, but because the federal government sat by and let it
happen.
The problems of the Nigerian federation were well-known, but I somehow
had felt that perhaps this was part of a nation’s maturation, and that given time
we would solve our problems. Then, suddenly, this incredible, horrific
experience happened—not just to a few people but to millions, together. I could
not escape the impact of this trauma happening to millions of people at the same
time. Suddenly I realized that the only valid basis for existence is one that gives
security to you and your people. It is as simple as that.5
When I finally got to Benin City, which is located roughly halfway from
Lagos to Igbo land in the Mid-West Region, there was a distinct atmospheric
change. The fact that the Mid-West was a neighbor of the East meant that at this

point there were Mid-Western Igbo policemen. It is important to recall that
during this period in Nigerian history the Igbos had large numbers in the police
force but not in the army, where their numbers were concentrated in the officer
corps. Crowds of policemen recognized me when I got to Benin City and
cheered, saying, “Oga, thank you!,” and let me through to continue my journey
without incident to Onitsha Bridge, and over the Niger River to the East.
It is pertinent to note that within the military there had been for at least half a
decade preceding the coup a great sense of alienation from and disillusionment
with the political class in Nigeria. They shared that feeling with a growing
number of ordinary Nigerians, and clearly with the writers and intellectuals. The
political class, oblivious of the growing disenchantment permeating literally
every strata of Nigerian society, was consumed with individual and ethnic
pursuits, and with the accumulation of material and other resources. Corruption
was widespread, and those in power were “using every means at their disposal,
including bribery, intimidation, and blackmail, to cling to power.”6
Many within the military leadership were increasingly concerned that they
were being asked to step in and set things right politically. In the first six years of
its post-independence existence Nigeria found itself calling on the armed forces
to quell two Tiv riots in the Middle Belt, crush the 1964 general strike, and
reestablish order following regional elections in the Western Region in 1965. In
hindsight, it seems as though President Azikiwe may have been aware of the
sand shifting beneath the feet of the political class, and he tried to gain the
support of the military brass during the constitutional crisis following the 1964
federal general election. The failure of Azikiwe’s attempt perhaps should have
been the first sign to many of us that trouble lay ahead for our young nation.7

BENIN ROAD
Speed is violence
Power is violence
Weight violence
The butterfly seeks safety in lightness
In weightless, undulating flight
But at a crossroads where mottled light
From old trees falls on a brash new highway
Our separate errands collide
I come power-packed for two
And the gentle butterfly offers
Itself in bright yellow sacrifice
Upon my hard silicon shield.1

A History of Ethnic Tension and
Resentment
I have written in my small book entitled The Trouble with Nigeria that Nigerians
will probably achieve consensus on no other matter than their common
resentment of the Igbo. The origin of the national resentment of the Igbo is as
old as Nigeria and quite as complicated. But it can be summarized thus: The
Igbo culture, being receptive to change, individualistic, and highly competitive,
gave the Igbo man an unquestioned advantage over his compatriots in securing
credentials for advancement in Nigerian colonial society. Unlike the
Hausa/Fulani he was unhindered by a wary religion, and unlike the Yoruba he
was unhampered by traditional hierarchies. This kind of creature, fearing no god
or man, was custom-made to grasp the opportunities, such as they were, of the
white man’s dispensations. And the Igbo did so with both hands. Although the
Yoruba had a huge historical and geographical head start, the Igbo wiped out
their handicap in one fantastic burst of energy in the twenty years between 1930
and 1950.1
Had the Igbo been a minor ethnic group of a few hundred thousand their
menace might have been easily and quietly contained. But their members ran in
the millions. As in J. P. Clark’s fine image of “ants filing out of the wood,” the
Igbo moved out of their forest home, scattered, and virtually seized the floor.2
Paul Anber explains:
With unparalleled rapidity, the Igbos advanced fastest in the shortest period of time of
all Nigeria’s ethnic groups. Like the Jews, to whom they have frequently been likened,
they progressed despite being a minority in the country, filling the ranks of the
nation’s educated, prosperous upper classes. . . . It was not long before the educational
and economic progress of the Igbos led to their becoming the major source of
administrators, managers, technicians, and civil servants for the country, occupying
senior positions out of proportion to their numbers. Particularly with respect to the
Federal public service and the government statutory corporations, this led to
accusations of an Igbo monopoly of essential services to the exclusion of other ethnic
groups.

The rise of the Igbo in Nigerian affairs was due to the self-confidence
engendered by their open society and their belief that one man is as good as

another, that no condition is permanent. It was not due, as non-Igbo observers
have imagined, to tribal mutual aid societies. The Igbo Town Union that has
often been written about was in reality an extension of the Igbo individualistic
ethic. The Igbo towns competed among themselves for certain kinds of social
achievement, like the building of schools, churches, markets, post offices, pipeborne water projects, roads, etc. They did not concern themselves with pan-Igbo
unity nor were they geared to securing an advantage over non-Igbo Nigerians.
The Igbo have no compelling traditional loyalty beyond town or village.3
There were a number of other factors that spurred the Igbos to educational,
economic, and political success. The population density in Igbo land created a
“land hunger”—a pressure on their low-fertility, laterite-laden soil for
cultivation, housing, and other purposes, factors that led ultimately to migration
to other parts of the nation: “In Northern Nigeria there were less than 3,000
Igbos in 1921; by 1931 the number had risen to nearly 12,000 and by 1952 to
over 130,000.”4
The coastal branches of the Yoruba nation had some of the earliest contact
with the European missionaries and explorers as a consequence of their
proximity to the shoreline and their own dedication to learning. They led the
entire nation in educational attainment from the late nineteenth to the early
twentieth centuries. By the time the Church Mission Society and a number of
Roman Catholic orders had crossed the Niger River and entered Igbo land, there
had been an explosion in the numbers of young Igbo students enrolled in school.
The increase was so exponential in such a short time that within three short
decades the Igbos had closed the gap and quickly moved ahead as the group with
the highest literacy rate, the highest standard of living, and the greatest
proportion of citizens with postsecondary education in Nigeria. The Igbo, for the
most part (at least until recently), respected the education that the colonizers had
brought with them. There was not only individual interest in the white man’s
knowledge, but family, community, and regional interest. It would not surprise
an observer that the “Igbos absorbed western education as readily as they
responded to urbanization.”5
I will be the first to concede that the Igbo as a group is not without its flaws.
Its success can and did carry deadly penalties: the dangers of hubris,
overweening pride, and thoughtlessness, which invite envy and hatred or, even
worse, that can obsess the mind with material success and dispose it to all kinds
of crude showiness. There is no doubt at all that there is a strand in
contemporary Igbo behavior that can offend by its noisy exhibitionism and

disregard for humility and quietness.6
Having acknowledged these facts,7 any observer can clearly see how the
competitive individualism and the adventurous spirit of the Igbo could have been
harnessed by committed leaders for the modernization and development of
Nigeria. Nigeria’s pathetic attempt to crush these idiosyncrasies rather than
celebrate them is one of the fundamental reasons the country has not developed
as it should and has emerged as a laughingstock.8
The ploy in the Nigerian context was simple and crude: Get the achievers out
and replace them with less qualified individuals from the desired ethnic
background so as to gain access to the resources of the state. This bizarre
government strategy transformed the federal civil service, corporations, and
universities into centers for ethnic bigotry and petty squabbles.9 It was in this
toxic environment that Professor Eni Njoku, an Igbo who was vice chancellor of
the University of Lagos, was forced out of office. An exasperated Kenneth
Onwuka Dike, an ethnic Igbo and the vice chancellor of the University of Ibadan
facing similar bouts of tribal small-mindedness, famously lamented during this
crisis that “intellectuals were the worst peddlers of tribalism.”10
One of the first signs I saw of an Igbo backlash came in the form of a 1966
publication from Northern Nigeria called The Nigerian Situation: Facts and
Background. In it the Igbo were cast as an assertive group that unfairly
dominated almost every sector of Nigerian society. No mention was made of the
culture of educational excellence imbibed from the British that pervaded Igbo
society and schools at the time. Special attention instead was paid to the
manpower distribution within the public services, where 45 percent of the
managers were Igbo “and it is threatening to reach 60 percent by 1968.
Moreover, regrettably though, [the] North’s future contribution”11 was credited
with only 10 percent of the existing posts.
Of particular dismay to the authors of the report were the situations in the
Nigerian Railway Corporation, in which over half of the posts were occupied by
Igbos; the Nigerian Ports Authority; and the Nigerian Foreign Service, in which
over 70 percent of the posts were held by Igbos. Probably the pettiest of the
accusations was the lamentation over the academic success of Easterners who
graduated in larger numbers in the 1965–66 academic year than their
counterparts from the West, Mid-West, and North.12
By the time the government of the Western Region also published a white
paper outlining the dominance of the ethnic Igbo in key government positions in
the Nigerian Railway Corporation and the Nigerian Ports Authority, the situation

for ethnic Igbos working in Western Nigeria in particular, but all over Nigeria in
general, had become untenable. This government-sanctioned environment of
hate and resentment created by self-serving politicians resulted in governmentsupervised persecutions, terminations, and dismissals of Nigerian citizens based
on their ethnicity.
In most other nations the success of an ethnic group as industrious as the
Igbo would stimulate healthy competition and a renaissance of learning and
achievement. In Nigeria it bred deep resentment and both subtle and overt
attempts to dismantle the structures in place for meritocracy in favor of
mediocrity, under the cloak of a need for “federal character”—a morally
bankrupt and deeply corrupt Nigerian form of the far more successful affirmative
action in the United States.13
The denial of merit is a form of social injustice that can hurt not only the
individuals directly concerned but ultimately the entire society. The motive for
the original denial may be tribal discrimination, but it may also come from
sexism, from political, religious, or some other partisan consideration, or from
corruption and bribery. It is unnecessary to examine these various motives
separately; it is sufficient to state that whenever merit is set aside by prejudice of
whatever origin, individual citizens as well as the nation itself are victimized.14,

The Army
Before I go further an effort should be made to explain the nature of the
dynamics at work within the Nigerian military at the time of the January 15,
1966, coup and the events that followed. Striking a balance between a level of
detail that will satisfy readers who still feel the impact of these events deeply and
that which will be palatable, if not to say comprehensible, to a less wellinformed reader is an impossibility, but I will strive to do so nonetheless.
Historians have argued incessantly about the makeup of the January 15,
1966, coup and its meaning. It was led by the so-called five majors, a cadre of
relatively junior officers whose front man of sorts was Chukwuma Nzeogwu.
Very few people outside military circles (with the exception of the poet
Christopher Okigbo) knew very much about him. What I heard of him was what
his friends or those who happened to know him were telling us. He seemed to be
a distant, mysterious figure.1
Nzeogwu had a reputation as a disciplined, no-nonsense, nonsmoking,
nonphilandering teetotaler, and as an anticorruption crusader. This reputation, we
were told, served him well as the chief instructor at the Nigerian Military
Training College (NMTC) in Kaduna,2 and in recruiting military “intellectuals.”
In the wee hours of January 15, 1966, in a broadcast to the nation, Nzeogwu
sought to explain “the coup attempt.” It happened that some journalists had
approached him to clarify the situation. Apparently the plan of the coup plotters
was to take control of the various military commands in Kaduna, Lagos, and
Enugu and to make a radio announcement from Lagos. Unbeknown to Nzeogwu,
who was still in Kaduna, the Lagos operation had failed, and most information
available to the population was coming from the BBC. Nzeogwu hastily put
together a speech that became notorious for its attacks on the political class,
bribery, and corruption.3
But by killing Sir Ahmadu Bello, Nzeogwu and the other coup plotters had
put themselves on a collision course with the religious, ethnic, and political
ramifications of such an action, something they had clearly not thought through
sufficiently.4
Superficially it was understandable to conclude that this was indeed “an Igbo

coup.” However, scratch a little deeper and complicating factors are discovered:
One of the majors was Yoruba, and Nzeogwu himself was Igbo in name only.
Not only was he born in Kaduna, the capital of the Muslim North, he was widely
known as someone who saw himself as a Northerner, spoke fluent Hausa and
little Igbo, and wore the Northern traditional dress when not in uniform. In the
end the Nzeogwu coup was crushed by the man who was the highest-ranking
Igbo officer in the Nigerian army, Major-General Aguiyi-Ironsi.5
We were to learn later that Aguiyi-Ironsi was also on the list of those to be
murdered. Ironsi got wind of the plot and mounted a successful resistance in
Lagos, ultimately breaking the back of the coup.6
Major-General Aguiyi-Ironsi emerged as Nigeria’s new head of state in late
May 1966. In a broadcast to the nation on May 24, 1966, Ironsi banned all
political parties and imposed what he called Decree No. 34 on a bewildered
country. The widely unpopular decree eliminated Nigeria’s federal structure and
put in place a unitary republic, which seemed to threaten more local patronage
networks. For the first time in history a federal military government was in
control of Nigeria.7
There was growing anger and dissatisfaction among officers from Northern
Nigeria, who wanted revenge for what they saw8 as an Igbo coup. Aguiyi-Ironsi,
a mild-mannered person, was reluctant to execute the Nzeogwu coup plotters,
who were serving stiff prison sentences. Nzeogwu was imprisoned at the Kirikiri
Maximum Security Prison in Lagos. It didn’t help matters that all the coup
plotters were eventually transferred to the Eastern Region, which at that time
was under the jurisdiction of Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, son of Sir Louis
Odumegwu Ojukwu.9

Countercoup and Assassination
Throughout this time there was a sense of great unease and tension across the
country, and multiple rumors of military insurrection in the offing. Prior to
Major-General Aguiyui-Ironsi’s ascension in May 1966, there were reports of
riots in Northern Nigeria. There are many reports of the genesis of these
spontaneous riots.1 Marauding Northern youths armed with machetes, knives,
and other instruments of death attacked unsuspecting civilians, mostly Igbos.
The mainly Igbo and other Easterners who fled to the Eastern Region from the
North during the May riots were persuaded to return to their livelihoods in the
North by Aguiyi-Ironsi, the head of state, and Odumegwu Ojukwu, the military
governor of Eastern Nigeria. These calls were predicated upon assurances from
the Northern Region’s governor, Hassan Katsina, that no harm would befall
them.2
By June several meetings had taken place among the Northern Nigerian
ruling elite. They sent representatives to meet with now general Ironsi, handing
him a list of their demands that included the revocation of the unpopular Decree
34; the courts-martial and punishment of the leaders of the January 15, 1966,
coup; and the discontinuation of any plans to investigate the underpinnings of
the May 1966 massacres in the North.3
Ironsi was alarmed that Northern leaders had been meeting without his
knowledge for several months, and he sensed a great deal of anger bubbling
beneath the surface. He made the ill-advised determination that, as Nigeria’s
head of state, he could appease and soothe concerns if he met with the leaders of
the regions.4 Ironsi embarked on a nationwide tour to calm growing fears of a
permanently fractured nation and to promote his notion of a unitary republic. He
stopped over in Ibadan as the guest of the military governor of Western Nigeria,
Lieutenant Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi. A close friend and confidant, Fajuyi made
Ironsi aware of rumors of a pending mutiny in the army.5
There are several accounts of what transpired next. What I was told by those
close to the army was that on July 29, 1966, Ironsi was arrested by Nigerian
army captain Theophilus Y. Danjuma, a Northerner, who wanted to know if
Ironsi was linked to the death of the Sardauna of Sokoto. There are divergent

accounts of what happened next. What is well known is that in a matter of hours
the bullet-ridden bodies of Ironsi and Fajuyi were discovered in the bush.6 These
executions would prove to be part of a larger and particularly bloody coup by
Northern officers led by Murtala Muhammed.7

The Pogroms
Looking back, the naively idealistic coup of January 15, 1966, proved a terrible
disaster. It was interpreted with plausibility as a plot by the ambitious Igbo of the
East to take control of Nigeria from the Hausa/Fulani North. Six months later, I
watched horrified as Northern officers carried out a revenge coup in which they
killed Igbo officers and men in large numbers. If it had ended there, the matter
might have been seen as a very tragic interlude in nation building, a horrendous
tit for tat. But the Northerners turned on Igbo civilians living in the North and
unleashed waves of brutal massacres that Colin Legum of The Observer (UK)
was the first to describe as a pogrom. Thirty thousand civilian men, women, and
children were slaughtered, hundreds of thousands were wounded, maimed, and
violated, their homes and property looted and burned—and no one asked any
questions. A Sierra Leonean living in Northern Nigeria at the time wrote home in
horror: “The killing of the Igbos has become a state industry in Nigeria.”1
What terrified me about the massacres in Nigeria was this: If it was only a
question of rioting in the streets and so on, that would be bad enough, but it
could be explained. It happens everywhere in the world. But in this particular
case a detailed plan for mass killing was implemented by the government—the
army, the police—the very people who were there to protect life and property.
Not a single person has been punished for these crimes. It was not just human
nature, a case of somebody hating his neighbor and chopping off his head. It was
something far more devastating, because it was a premeditated plan that
involved careful coordination, awaiting only the right spark.
Throughout the country at this time, but particularly in Igbo intellectual
circles, there was much discussion of the difficulties of coexisting in a nation
with such disparate peoples and religious and cultural backgrounds. As early as
October 1966, some were calling for outright war.2 Most of us, however, were
still hoping for a peaceful solution. Many talked of a confederation, though few
knew how it would look.
In the meantime, the Eastern Region was tackling the herculean task of
resettling the refugees who were pouring into the East in the hundreds of
thousands. It was said at the time that the number of displaced Nigerian citizens

fleeing from other parts of the nation back to Eastern Nigeria was close to a
million.

The Aburi Accord
The absence of a concerted plan to address the eruption of violence throughout
Nigeria against Easterners, mainly Igbos, and the inaction around the refugee
problem amplified the anger and tensions between the federal government, now
led by Lieutenant Colonel Yakubu Gowon, and the Eastern Region. Calls in the
East for independence grew louder, and threats from the deferral government
grew more ominous, in a vicious cycle.
A last-ditch summit was held from January 4 to January 5, 1967, to discuss
the areas of conflict. Great optimism was expressed that this would be the
instrument to bring lasting peace to Nigeria. Aburi, in Ghana, was chosen as the
venue, as a concession to Ojukwu, who had asked for a neutral site outside
Nigeria for this meeting, but also to impart a sense of impartiality and credibility
to the summit. A document memorializing the areas of shared understanding was
produced after two days of meetings. It would be known as the Aburi Accord.1
The gathering was attended by senior military and police officials2 and
government secretaries.3 Topics for discussion included: a committee to work
out a constitutional future for Nigeria; the back payment of salaries to Igbo
government employees who were forced to leave their posts as a result of the
disturbances; the need for a resolution renouncing the use of force; and the
refusal of the Eastern Region to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Yakubu Gowon as
supreme commander. The predicament of displaced persons following the
pogroms in the North, the fate of soldiers involved in disturbances on January
15, 1966, and the planned distribution of power between the federal military
government and the regional governments also required urgent attention.4
The goal of the Gowon-led Nigerian government was to emerge from these
deliberations with Nigeria intact as a confederation of the regions. Many
intellectuals and key members of Ojukwu’s cabinet in the East had been battling
with solutions to these issues for months before the Aburi meetings, thinking
through various possible answers to these key questions: What is a
confederation? How would it work in the Nigerian setting? How much power
would be delegated to the central federal government as opposed to the regions?
In my estimation there was not as much rigorous thought given by Gowon’s

federal cabinet and the powerful interests in the North. The two parties therefore
left Aburi with very different levels of understanding of what a confederation
meant and how it would work in Nigeria.5
By March 1967, two months after the summit in Aburi, Ghana, the Aburi
Accord resolutions had yet to be implemented, and there was growing weariness
in the East that Gowon had no intention of doing so. The government of the
Eastern Region warned Gowon that his repeated failure to act on issues
pertaining to Nigerian sovereignty could lead to secession.
Gowon responded by issuing a decree, Decree 8, which called for the
resurrection of the proposals for constitutional reform promulgated during the
Aburi conference. But for reasons hard to explain other than as egotistical selfpreservation, members of the federal civil service galvanized themselves in
energetic opposition to the agreements of the Aburi Accord. Seeing this
development as a strategic political opening, the Yoruba leader, Obafemi
Awolowo, the West’s political kingpin, heretofore nursing political trouble
himself, including prior imprisonment for sedition, insisted that the federal
government remove all Northern military troops garrisoned in Lagos, Ibadan,
Abeokuta, and throughout the Western Region—a demand similar to those
Ojukwu had made earlier, during the crisis.6
Awolowo warned Gowon’s federal government that if the Eastern Region left
the federation the Western Region would not be far behind. This statement was
considered sufficiently threatening by Gowon and the federal government to
merit a complete troop withdrawal.
There were increasing indications that Northern leaders never had any
intention of implementing the settlement negotiated at Aburi. Ojukwu at this
point was exasperated by what he saw as purposeful inaction from Gowon.
During March through April 1967 he responded by instituting a systematic
process that severed all Biafran ties to Nigeria: First he froze all official
communication with Lagos, and he then followed this swiftly by disconnecting
the “Eastern regional government’s administration and revenues from those of
the federal government.”7
I was in Lagos at the time. This event was so big that I cannot even in
retrospect fully explain exactly what was happening. People were confused. I
was confused myself. People who are confused in such a situation generally act
with great desperation, emotion—some would say without logic.
The movement toward a declaration of independence was very clear and
sharp, because it was a result of a particular group of Nigerian citizens from the

Eastern Region attempting to protect themselves from the great violence that had
been organized and executed by arms of the government of the Federal Republic
of Nigeria. There was a strong sense that Nigeria was no longer habitable for the
Igbo and many other peoples from Eastern Nigeria.
That epiphany made us realize that Nigeria “did not belong we,” as Liberians
would put it. “This country belong we” was the popular pidgin English mantra
from their liberation struggle. That was not the case for Igbo people and many
others from Eastern Nigeria. Nigeria did not belong to us. It was now clear to
many of us that we, the Nigerian people, were not what we had thought we were.
The Nigeria that meant so much to all of us was not reciprocating the affection
we had for it. The country had not embraced us, the Igbo people and other
Easterners, as full-fledged members of the Nigerian family. That was the
predicament that the Igbo and many peoples from Eastern Nigeria found
themselves in, and one that informed Ojukwu’s decisions, I believe, on the eve
of civil war.
The first part of May 1967 saw the visit of the National Reconciliation
Commission (NRC) to Enugu, the capital of the Eastern Region. It was led by
Chief Awolowo and billed as a last-minute effort at peace and as an attempt to
encourage Ojukwu and Eastern leaders to attend peace talks at a venue suitable
to the Easterners. Despite providing a friendly reception, many Igbo leaders
referred to the visit disdainfully as the “chop, chop, talk, talk, commission.” A
majority of Easterners by this time had grown contemptuous of Gowon’s federal
government for its failure to bring the culprits of the mass murders in the North
to justice, and they saw this as the latest in a series of insincere overtures. Senior
Igbo military officers were also openly voicing their concern that Gowon was an
illegitimate leader, because he was not the most senior officer in the chain of
military command, and so had no right to be head of state.
There were a number of distinguished and well-meaning Nigerians on the
National Reconciliation Commission, but they were meeting with leaders of an
emotionally and psychologically exhausted and disillusioned Igbo people. Many
of these same Igbo leaders had been at the vanguard of independence struggles,
and after years of spearheading the “one Nigeria” mantra, had very little to show
for it. Clearly the situation had become untenable.8
On May 24, 1967, in the midst of this chaos, my wife went into labor. I sent
my close friend, the poet Christopher Okigbo, to the hospital she had been
admitted to to find out when the birth would take place, and then to call me at
home, where I had briefly returned to rest and take a shower. In characteristic

Okigbo fashion, he waited for the delivery, went to the nursery to see the baby,
and then drove back to convey the news to me that my wife had delivered our
third child, Chidi—“There is a God”—and that the way his baby locks were
arranged, he looked like he had had a haircut and was ready to go to school! The
baby’s arrival was a great joy, but I couldn’t but feel a certain amount of
apprehension for this infant, indeed for all of us, as the prospect of civil war cast
a dark shadow over our lives.

The Nightmare Begins
May the twenty-sixth saw an emergency meeting of Ojukwu’s special Advisory
Committee of Chiefs and Elders in Enugu. The consensus was building across
his cabinet that secession was the only viable path. “On May 27, the
Consultative Assembly mandated Colonel Ojukwu to declare, at the earliest
practicable date, Eastern Nigeria a free sovereign and independent state by the
name and title of the Republic of Biafra.”1
It is crucial to note that the decision of an entire people, the Igbo people, to
leave Nigeria, did not come from Ojukwu alone but was informed by the desires
of the people and mandated by a body that contained some of the most
distinguished Nigerians in history: Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria’s, former
governor-general and first ceremonial president; Dr. Michael I. Okpara and Sir
Francis Ibiam, former premier and governor of Eastern Nigeria, respectively;
and Supreme Court justice Sir Louis Mbanefo. Others included: the educator Dr.
Alvan Ikoku; first republic minister Mr. K. O. Mbadiwe; as well as Mr. N. U.
Akpan; Mr. Joseph Echeruo; Ekukinam-Bassey; Chief Samuel Mbakwe; Chief
Jerome Udoji; and Chief Margaret Ekpo.
In a speech to the nation on May 27, 1967, Gowon responded to Ojukwu’s
“assault on Nigeria’s unity and blatant revenue appropriation,” as the federal
government saw it, by calling a state of emergency and dividing the nation into
twelve states.2
The official position from the federal government was that the creation of
new states was an important move to foster unity and stability in Nigeria. Many
suspect a more Machiavellian scheme at work here.3 Gowon, understanding
inter-ethnic rivalry, suspected that dividing the East into four states, landlocking
the Igbos into the East Central State and isolating the oil-producing areas of
Nigeria outside Igbo land, would weaken secessionist sentiments in the region
and empower minority groups that lived in oil-producing regions to stand up to
what they had already dreaded for years—the prospects of Igbo domination.4
On May 30, 1967, Ojukwu, citing a variety of malevolent acts directed at the
mainly Igbo Easterners—such as the pogrom that claimed over thirty thousand
lives; the federal government’s failure to ensure the safety of Easterners in the

presence of organized genocide; and the direct incrimination of the government
in the murders of its own citizens—proclaimed the independence of the Republic
of Biafra from Nigeria, with the full backing of the Eastern House Constituent
Assembly.5 By taking this action Ojukwu had committed us to full-blown war.
Nigeria would never be the same again.

The Nigeria-Biafra War
To fully comprehend some of the competing positions during the Nigeria-Biafra
War, it may be useful to begin with an examination of the local and international
response to Biafra.

THE BIAFRAN POSITION
Beginning with the January 15, 1966, coup d’état, through the countercoup
(staged mainly by Northern Nigerian officers, who murdered 185 Igbo officers1)
and the massacre of thirty thousand Igbos and Easterners in pogroms that started
in May 1966 and occurred over four months—the events of those months left
millions of other future Biafrans and me feeling terrified. As we fled “home” to
Eastern Nigeria to escape all manner of atrocities that were being inflicted upon
us and our families in different parts of Nigeria, we saw ourselves as victims.
When we noticed that the federal government of Nigeria did not respond to our
call to end the pogroms, we concluded that a government that failed to safeguard
the lives of its citizens has no claim to their allegiance and must be ready to
accept that the victims deserve the right to seek their safety in other ways—
including secession.

THE NIGERIAN ARGUMENT
Nigeria’s position on Biafra, as I understand it, was hinged on the premise that if
Biafra was allowed to secede then a number of other ethnic nationalities within
Nigeria would follow suit.2 The Nigerian government, therefore, had to block
Biafra’s secession to prevent the dissolution of Nigeria.3

THE ROLE OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) attempted to facilitate a number of

“peace meetings” throughout the conflict. The umbrella body of sovereign
African nations lacked credibility in this effort, in my opinion, as it harbored a
strong One Nigeria bias from the very beginning of the war. The OAU’s initial
attempts to bring about peace talks—with meetings slated for Kampala, the
capital of Uganda, in May 1968, and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (at the OAU
headquarters), in July 1968—were ineffectual, and quickly disintegrated into
fiascos of confusion.4
Facing international pressure and ridicule for failing to mediate effectively
between the two warring parties,5 the OAU’s consultative committee, which was
made up of diplomats from Liberia, Ghana, Niger, Ethiopia, the Congo, and
Camaroon, quickly re-sent invitations to the heads of state of Nigeria and Biafra
—Yakubu Gowon and Emeka Ojukwu—for talks in Niamey, the capital of
Niger, Nigeria’s northern neighbor.6
The summit, from what I later learned, became a case of “sliding doors,”
with Gowon arriving and meeting with OAU principals ahead of the visit by
Ojukwu. This treatment, meant to avoid confrontation, created the opposite
effect and played no small part in diminishing the possible results that the first
president of the Republic of Niger, Hamani Diori, was attempting to moderate.
Professor Eni Njoku, the chief negotiator from Biafra, gallantly attempted to
salvage what was left of that Nigeria-Biafra summit. He arranged a meeting with
the leader of the Mid-West Region government’s delegation, Chief Anthony
Enahoro, that closed in an impasse.7
Ojukwu saw an opportunity to speak to a world audience at the next summit
and agreed to attend; it was planned for August in the Ethiopian capital of Addis
Ababa. He treated the gathered delegates to a speech of over two hours in length,
and made the case for Biafran independence. He pointed out the great irony of
the conflict, one that most of us in Biafra were already aware of: Having
spearheaded the fight for Nigerian independence, Biafrans were later driven out
by the rest of Nigeria, which waged war with the secessionist republic to
conserve the very sovereignty of a nation (Nigeria) within whose walls Biafrans
did not feel free, safe, or desired.8
In my opinion, Gowon’s absence at these meetings was telling, because it
clearly suggested that he had a different agenda. This suspicion would be
confirmed by his announcement of a surge in the Nigerian offensive that would
increase exponentially the numbers dying and starving to death in the coming
months.
Most African countries adhered to the doctrines of the Organization of

African Unity, which supported Nigeria for the same reasons espoused by the
great powers: “[A]llowing Biafra to secede would result in the destabilization of
the entire continent.”9 There were a few prominent nations in Africa that openly
declared support for the Biafran cause for humanitarian, ethical, and moral
reasons. Tanzania’s Nyerere, one of the few survivors of the cold war tussle on
the continent and a towering African statesman of the era, saw Biafra’s attempts
to secede through the lens of “the Jews seeking a homeland following the
Holocaust in Nazi Germany and elsewhere in Europe.”10
President Julius Nyerere was the first African head of state to recognize
Biafra. His statement was published by the government printer in Tanzania’s
capital, Dar es Salam, on April 13, 1968. The day we heard that Tanzania had
recognized Biafra “was a fantastic day.” I remember it vividly. “I was sitting in
my home with my wife; we were feeling very depressed, I don’t know why, then
suddenly somebody ran in and told us [the good news], and we said, ‘Don’t be
silly,’ because we [did not believe him]. And then we heard [the same news] on
the BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation], and my wife rushed up” to tell me.
She was so elated and
said she was going to teach in Tanzania. Soon after that the streets were filled with
people dancing and singing. For the first time in months you found dancing again, and
the radio was playing Tanzanian music. People were reassured again that there was
justice in the world, because we were already becoming quite cynical about the
outside world, saying, “Don’t imagine anyone would come to your rescue—they
know you’re right, but it doesn’t pay, so they won’t do anything.” We were more or
less persuaded that we would have to fight on our own. [Nyerere’s] gesture meant
nothing in military or material terms but it assured us—the effect it had on us—was
electric.11

Other African leaders—Zambia’s Kenneth Kaunda, Gabon’s Omar Bongo,
and Ivory Coast’s Houphouët-Boigny—also officially recognized Biafra. I later
learned that Boigny was ideologically opposed to large African states and helped
develop France’s well-planned decolonization policy in West Africa during his
days as a parliamentarian in Paris.12 Boigny could have very well convinced a
sympathetic Charles de Gaulle to support Biafra in order to achieve this
ideological vision. Whatever his agenda was, it was to Houphouët-Boigny’s
Ivory Coast that Ojukwu would escape after the fall of Biafra in January 1970.
There were other attempts to garner recognition for secessionist Biafra
beyond the African continent, including wide international ones. Those who
followed our story were aware of the shared history between Biafra and several
Caribbean nations, where descendants of former Igbo slaves now lived. That

historical connection was employed by Biafran emissaries with some success.
Biafra’s diplomatic delegation, led by Dr. Okechukwu Ikejiani and Mr.
Chukwuma Azikiwe, met with Dr. François Duvalier, president of Haiti, at the
presidential palace in Port-au-Prince in February 1969. Following that visit, on
March 22, 1969, Biafra secured the only non-African full diplomatic recognition
—from the Haitian people.13

The Triangle Game: The UK, France, and
the United States1
Great Britain’s official response to the conflict, we were told, was predicated
upon the fact that as our “former colonial master,” she would not stand for the
breakup of one of her prized colonies, especially one she had worked hard to
develop. Michael Leapman’s report in The Independent in 1998 uncovers a far
more cynical attitude. This paragraph confirmed what a number of us in Biafra
already suspected about Harold Wilson’s government:
Cabinet papers for [1967], just released, show how the decision to continue arming
Nigeria was not based on arguments for or against secession, or on the interests of its
people, but on backing the likely winner. It is a case study in realpolitik. As one
Commonwealth Office briefing document to the prime minister put it: “The sole
immediate British interest is to bring the [Nigerian] economy back to a condition in
which our substantial trade and investment can be further developed.”2

The BBC’s Rick Fountain, in a story on Monday, January 3, 2000, called
“Secret Papers Reveal Biafra Intrigue,” confirms that oil interests and
competition between Britain, France, and the United States played a far more
important role than the “unified Nigeria” position:
At first Biafra was successful and this alarmed Britain, the former colonial power,
anxious for its big oil holdings. It also interested the Soviet Union which saw a chance
to increase its influence in West Africa. Both sent arms to boost the federal military
government, under General Yakubu Gowon.
But France, the other big former colonial power in the region, also took a
hand. . . . Although Paris repeatedly denied arming the Biafrans, the newly released
papers reveal intelligence reports showing that very large weapon shipments were
reaching Biafra via two neighboring Francophone states, Ivory Coast and Gabon. The
UK intelligence services warned that Soviet penetration was growing but that this did
not much trouble Paris. The British reports say the French objective “appears to be the
breakup of Nigeria, which threatens, by its size and potential, to overshadow France’s
client Francophone states in West Africa.”3

I was aware from my contacts in England that many Britons were not
pleased with the unsolicited leadership role Harold Wilson’s government was
playing in the bloody conflict in their former African colony. Emotional
antipathy among the British public grew sufficiently as the conflict progressed to

threaten the British Labor government’s reelection chances. British journalists,
writers, and intellectuals found the situation appalling as well. “The Times of
London complain[ed] that Britain’s Nigerian policy is a failure. . . . [T]here is a
serious loss of touch in the conduct of British foreign policy.”4
Harold Wilson’s government soon found itself awash in a public relations
nightmare at home and abroad.5 Wilson personally accused Ojukwu of
attempting to garner sympathy by exploiting the casualties of a war to which his
government was supplying arms!6 The bombing of civilian targets in Biafra by
the Nigerian air force made the evening news and appeared in the major
newspapers in Great Britain and “stirred a hornet’s nest” of outrage from the
British people. Things were so tense that British dockworkers reportedly refused
to load ships with British arms heading for Lagos, protesting that they were
being used to kill “Biafran babies.”
By the time the Nigerian air force shot down a Swedish Red Cross plane
carrying humanitarian supplies and medicines to the sick and dying in Biafra,
killing all aboard, there was, understandably, an “outbreak of public anguish” in
Britain. That distress grew even worse shortly after this, with the awful news
that the International Red Cross’s director, Dr. August Lindt, and his aides were
detained for nearly sixteen hours following their arrival in Lagos for a tour of
humanitarian relief sites in Biafra and talks with Nigerian government officials.7
Across the English Channel, there was uplifting news. On July 31, 1968,
Biafran diplomacy reached a milestone when the French Council of Ministers
released a statement of approbation in support of Biafra, though it fell short of a
full recognition of the secessionist republic:
The Government [of France] considers that the bloodshed and suffering endured for
over a year by the population of Biafra demonstrate their will to assert themselves as a
people. Faithful to its principles, the French Government therefore considers that the
present conflict should be solved on the basis of the right of peoples to selfdetermination and should include the setting in motion of appropriate international
procedures.8

There was great excitement about this news in Biafra. Charles de Gaulle was
a widely respected European leader who fought the Nazis valiantly during World
War II from his base in Africa. I personally hoped that de Gaulle’s extensive
knowledge of the continent’s history and political affairs would result in a
sophisticated response to the crisis. I was encouraged when I heard that he was
toying with the possibility of an outright statement of recognition of the
Republic of Biafra. Also buoyed by this news, the Biafran head of state,

Ojukwu, sent emissaries to Paris to lobby for full French credence, which we all
mistakenly assumed was in the bag, but also for de Gaulle to help persuade the
United States government to support the Biafran cause.9
I discovered later that Jacques Foccart—described as “the most powerful
man in the fifth republic” by eminent French journalist Pierre Péan—was the
chief architect of French policy on the African continent. It was Foccart, I
understand, who convinced the French parliament and de Gaulle to respond
forcefully to the humanitarian disaster in Biafra.10
De Gaulle needed little persuasion. It was well-known that he bore a deep
resentment of the British for what he saw as their unhelpful role in the French
resistance (La Résistance française) during World War II. Foccart, in his
memoirs, informs us that Paris increased this Anglo-French rivalry by making
aggressive diplomatic inroads into Ghana (a former British colony, which was
surrounded by the former French colonies Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, and Ivory
Coast).11 Some Africanists believe that the Gaullist objective seemed to be to
neutralize Ghana and diminish Nigeria as a regional power, and thereby contract
Great Britain’s sphere of influence in West Africa.
There were other French interests that later came to light: Paris wanted the
French oil company Elf Aquitaine (which had a smaller market share in
Nigeria’s oil industry) to have a greater footprint in the West African region
consistent with Jacques Foccart’s vision of French dominance.12 Whatever
French motivations might have been, we were grateful in Biafra to be receiving
their support.
The United States of America was officially “neutral” during the conflict,
which meant that it overtly supported neither the Nigerians nor the Biafrans.13
Those of us who wanted a more aggressive pro-Biafra stance from America,
particularly on humanitarian grounds, were deeply disappointed, to put it mildly.
Covertly, however, it was alleged that Washington under President Lyndon
Johnson, before he left office in January 1968, was aiding the Nigerian war
effort, in cooperation with the British. His government also had a number of runins with Biafran authorities over the role of the International Red Cross,
America’s chief humanitarian organ for getting relief to the needy in Biafra,
particularly after Gowon and his government imposed a blockade.
Several months into the conflict, however, the Nixon administration, initially
toeing the Johnson administration’s line of “neutral engagement in support of a
one Nigeria,” took a more proactive role and called for the cessation of
hostilities. It was the government of the much maligned Richard Nixon that

raised concerns about Nigerian military strategy and levied the charges of ethnic
cleansing and genocide against the Nigerian forces. Despite what some of us saw
as a cynical disinterest on the part of the American government, the American
people were characteristically generous and magnanimous in spirit; they sent
millions of humanitarian dollars to ease the suffering of the innocent caught
between the belligerents.14
The leaders of the African American civil rights community were
understandably horrified by the breakdown in law and order in Nigeria. The
black intelligentsia—colleagues of Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks—were
scholars of the nonviolence movement. On several occasions they came out
forcefully against all forms of ferocity during the Nigeria-Biafra conflict,
reacting with dismay at the magnitude of the human suffering in Biafra. They
sent numerous forms of communication both to Ojukwu and Gowon to put an
end to the bloody civil war. They were particularly appalled by the widespread
hunger and starvation of Biafrans and by the millions of stranded refugees, all of
which they reiterated was “unacceptable to civilized world opinion.”15
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
was particularly critical of the brutality of the conflict. The leader of the
influential civil rights group, Roy Wilkins, implored the Nigerians especially to
be more humane in their treatment of the Biafrans. He made a moral argument to
end the food blockade by reminding Gowon that the need to save the lives of the
thousands starving daily “outweighed any military or political considerations.”16
My admiration of the African American civil rights community was due not only
to their moral positions on racial equality and the quest for peaceful coexistence
of all peoples, but also on their arbitration during the Biafran struggle—an
intervention that brought succor to millions and helped place a moral lens on the
atrocities taking place in my homeland.
The Soviet Union had no significant presence in the region prior to 1966 but
progressively took greater interest in Nigerian affairs after the Aguiyi-Ironsi
coup d’état and the emergence of Nigeria as an important oil exporter. The initial
neutrality of the USSR’s Western rivals, including Britain and the United States
in particular, I gather, provided an opening for the Soviets to send MiG fighters
and technical assistance to the Nigerians, thereby including the region in the cold
war theater.17
There were other reasons for the ever-growing Soviet presence in Nigeria in
1969.18 The Soviets had announced their intention to expand their bilateral trade
agreements with Nigeria to include military and economic assistance. They had

their eyes on a truly large prize: a contract to build one of the largest steel mills
in all of Africa, at a cost of a then astonishing $120 million.19 That steel
investment later became the Ajaokuta Steel Mill in northern Nigeria—the poster
child of corruption and white elephant projects in Africa—that went on to gulp
over $4.6 billion of the Nigerian taxpayers’ money although very little steel was
produced.20
The Portuguese, it should be made clear, had a more nebulous role with
regard to Biafra. Portugal did not overtly back one side over the other during the
conflict, which generated a great deal of talk and speculation. The extent of the
Biafran relationship with Portugal was quite simply one that said, We will
support you quietly. . . . Your planes can land in our territory—São Tomé. Rajat
Neogy of Transition magazine probed to find out from me whether there was
more to our relationship. My position at the time was understandably passionate:
I am not interested in what motives Portugal may have. If the devil himself had
offered his air facilities we would have taken it, and I would have supported it.
Portugal was very clever when it realized we were about to be exterminated, and said,
“You can land at my airport,” and that, as far as I know, is the extent of Biafran
association with Portugal. Portugal has not given us any arms. We buy arms on the
black market. What we cannot get elsewhere, we try and make.21

The Chinese entered the contest late, albeit on the side of the Biafrans.
Reports of Chinese technical and military assistance have been widely cited.
Nevertheless, all told, the callous interference of the great powers led to great
despair and a prolongation of the tragedy.22

The Writers and Intellectuals
Some of the leading international thinkers of the era were so appalled by the
Biafran tragedy that they took it upon themselves to pay the breakaway republic
a visit and get a firsthand look at the suffering, the destitution, and the starvation.
Auberon Waugh came and afterward wrote a devastating book on Harold
Wilson’s duplicitous policy. He also named his newborn child Biafra Waugh!
There was a small group of American writers—Kurt Vonnegut,1 Herbert Gold,
and Harvey Swados—who came to show solidarity with me and other
beleaguered Biafran writers.2
Vonnegut was so devastated following his trip that he cried for weeks. Todd
Davis reports that
Vonnegut’s response to his trip to Biafra was not suicide, but tears. He recounts his
return to Manhattan, where he checked in to [sic] the Royalton Hotel (his family was
skiing in Vermont): “I found myself crying so hard I was barking like a dog. I didn’t
come close to doing that after World War II” [Fates 174]. [His experiences in] Biafra
and Mozambique, quite obviously, play a part in the author’s consistent plea that we
respect one another, an action that must involve our participation in meeting the needs
of the global community.3

Kurt left in the seminal essay “Biafra: A People Betrayed” a glowing
testament to his observations.
Geoffrey Hill, the British poet, Douglas Killam, the Canadian literary critic
and scholar, Stanley Diamond, and the amiable Conor Cruise O’Brien all visited
Biafra. Diamond brought something additional—a long-standing scholarly
interest and expertise in the territory.4 This world-renowned anthropologist
became an “intellectual Biafran warrior,”5 galvanizing a formidable American
and Canadian intellectual response to the tragedy.
Diamond’s knowledge of Nigeria came from having done extensive
fieldwork in parts of the country right from the last days of the British raj, and he
followed its affairs closely through independence, and after. He understood the
ideological dimension of the Nigeria-Biafra conflict. He was not fooled by the
strenuous effort of Britain to pass off her former colony as a success story of
African independence, when in fact it had only passed, with Britain’s active
collaboration, from colonial to neocolonial status. He saw the bloody civil war

not as Harold Wilson and other apologists for Nigeria presented it—that is, as
progressive nationalism fighting “primitive” tribalism—but as the ruining of a
rare and genuine national culture at the moment of its birth.
It was advantageous to the federal Nigerian case to stigmatize Biafra for its
alleged links with South Africa and Portugal. Diamond pointed out that it was
the Czechoslovakians and the Chinese, not South Africans or Portuguese, who
supplied the bulk of Biafra’s arms in the first year of the war, and that the Czech
source dried up after the Prague spring reform movement was crushed by Soviet
tanks and the fall of Alexander
in 1968.
The moment has come for Nigerians and the world to ask the proper
questions and draw the right inferences about what happened in those terrible
years. Stanley Diamond’s perceptions will, no doubt, be a great help to us. They
are rooted in prodigious learning and a profoundly humane sensibility. I am
happy that this remarkable man, who has searched far, who has found and
reclaimed the uncluttered vision of the “primitive” at the crossroads of science
and song, has bestowed on my country the benefit of his deep scholarly,
humanistic, and spiritual meditation.
The New York Review of Books of May 22, 1969, carried a long article,
“Biafra Revisited,” by Conor Cruise O’Brien on the second visit he made with
Diamond to the secessionist enclave. It was accompanied by a poem I had just
written in memory of Christopher Okigbo, Africa’s greatest modern poet, who
had recently died on the Biafran battlefield. It also carried a profoundly moving
poem, “Sunday in Biafra,” by Stanley Diamond that, like all his poetry,
combines startling substantiality with haunting ease and inevitability, and it
stamps on the mind like an icon of Africa’s tragedy an image and logic that
nothing will remove.6
Nigerian author Enzwa-Ohaeto later wrote, “O’Brien was convinced that the
‘survival of Biafra’ would be ‘a victory for African courage, endurance, and
skill, and an opportunity for the further development of African creativity.’ In his
report on that visit in The New York Review of Books, he points out that of the
‘two best known writers, . . . Achebe is a convinced Biafran patriot and the other,
the playwright Wole Soyinka (a Yoruba) is a prisoner in Northern Nigeria.’”7 Of
critical importance to the entire debate around the Biafran affair was O’Brien’s
conclusion: “‘[N]o one seriously interested in African literature, in its relation to
African social and political life, can have failed to ponder the meaning of the
choices and fates of these two men.’”8

The War and the Nigerian Intellectual
The war came as a surprise to the vast majority of artists and intellectuals on
both sides of the conflict. We had not realized just how fragile, even weak,
Nigeria was as a nation. Only a few Nigerians, such as the poet Christopher
Okigbo, had early and privileged insights into the Nigerian-Biafran crisis.
We, the intellectuals, were deeply disillusioned by the ineptitude of Nigeria’s
ruling elite and by what we saw taking place in our young nation. As far as their
relationship with the masses was concerned, Nigerian politicians, we felt, had
slowly transformed themselves into the personification of Anwu.—the wasp—a
notorious predator from the insect kingdom. Wasps, African children learn
during story time, greet unsuspecting prey with a painful, paralyzing sting, then
lay eggs on their body, which then proceed to “eat the victim alive.”
Intellectuals had other reasons to despair: We were especially disheartened
by the disintegration of the state because we were brought up in the belief that
we were destined to rule. Our Northern Nigerian brethren had similar
sentiments, but those feelings came from a totally different understanding of the
world.
This opinion may explain why so many intellectuals played an active role in
various capacities during the war years. Some of us evolved into “public
intellectuals” through the period of the national crisis leading up to the war and
exposed distortions and misrepresentations within the political system. Once the
war began, however, many, particularly those of us in Biafra, drew upon the
teachings of our ancient traditions.
Nri philosophy implores intellectuals to transform themselves into “warriors
of peace” during periods of crisis, with a proclivity for action over rhetoric.
Many of our finest writers and thinkers were armed with this ancient wisdom
and worked toward a peaceful resolution to the hostilities.
Cyprian Ekwensi was one of the pioneers of the West African literary
renaissance of the twentieth century. He was the author of numerous works, such
as An African Night’s Entertainment, The Passport of Mallam Ilia, Burning
Grass, The Drummer Boy, and Jagua Nana. When the war broke out Ekwensi
left his job as director of the Nigerian Ministry of Information and served the

Biafran cause in the Bureau of External Publicity, and as a roving ambassador
for the people of the enclave. During the war years I traveled with Ekwensi and
Gabriel Okara on several diplomatic voyages on behalf of the people of Biafra.
Wole Soyinka was already regarded by this time as Africa’s foremost
dramatist. He had published The Swamp Dweller, The Lion and the Jewel, and
The Trials of Brother Jero as well as collections of poetry. The Road is
considered by many to be his greatest play. A Dance of the Forest, a biting
criticism of Nigeria’s ruling classes, was the first of what was to become his
signature role—as one of the most consistent critics of misrule from his
generation. His 1964 novel, The Interpreters, as well as ventures into recording,
film, and poetry, showcased his versatility. Soyinka’s attempts to avert a fullblown civil war by meeting with Colonel Ojukwu and Victor Banjo, as well as
with then lieutenant colonel Olusegun Obasanjo, would earn him enemies in the
Nigerian federal government and a twenty-two-month imprisonment.
The story I was told about this incident was that Wole, fed up with the
federal government’s unsuccessful treatment of the Biafra issue, had traveled to
secessionist Biafra in an attempt to appeal for a cease-fire to the hostilities. He
planned to set up an antiwar delegation made up of intellectuals, artists, and
writers from both sides of the conflict—and from around the world—to achieve
his aim. When he returned to Nigeria the authorities arrested him and accused
him of assisting Biafra in the purchase of weapons of war.1 There was no
evidence to corroborate their case, and Wole was imprisoned without bail. Later,
to justify holding him without evidence, the federal government accused Wole of
being a Biafran agent or spy, trumped-up charges that he categorically denied. I
remember relating my disgust about Soyinka’s predicament to the editors of
Transition in 1968 during the war: “I have no intention of being placed in a
Nigerian situation at all. I find it intolerable. I find the Nigerian situation
untenable. If I had been a Nigerian, I think I would have been in the same
situation as Wole Soyinka is—in prison.”2
There was great concern for Wole’s health and safety as time went on. For
many of the months he was in prison he was held in solitary confinement and
moved from one prison to another. Most of us in Biafra were appalled. PEN
International and many major writers of the time—Norman Mailer comes to
mind—led a vigorous protest on his behalf, but he was not released until close to
the very end of the war.
Professor Kenneth Onwuka Dike inspired us all very greatly and deserves
special attention. He was a pioneer in so many respects. He was one of the first

pupils to attended Dennis Memorial Grammar School. After that he traveled to
the Gold Coast to attend Achimota College, and then went farther afield to Sierra
Leone to attend Fourah Bay College before proceeding to England for
undergraduate studies. He received his bachelor of science degree at the Durham
University, England, and his master of arts degree from the University of
Aberdeen, in Scotland. After a few years of study at Oxford, he earned his PhD
in history from the University of London and returned to Nigeria, first to join the
faculty, but later to become the first indigenous vice chancellor of University
College, Ibadan.
In the late 1960s, the Ford and Rockefeller foundations decided to set up the
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture somewhere in Nigeria, under the
leadership of the former president of North Dakota State University, Fargo, Dr.
Herbert R. Albrecht; Dike, along with Dr. T. A. Lambo, were among the
Nigerians consulted. Dike suggested the prestigious institute be founded on a
twenty-three-hundred-acre campus, in a loose affiliation with University
College, Ibadan. And so it was. Dike was involved in several of these kinds of
projects. For example, he was also instrumental in the establishment of the
Nigerian National Archives.
Everyone who knew him will acknowledge that Dike was one of the most
“detribalized” Nigerians of his generation. This point requires emphasis. A man
of this ilk, a rare breed indeed, watched horrified at the disintegration of the
nation that he and so many others had fought to establish. His sentiments would
change to despair and anger following the massacre of thirty thousand Easterners
and the rising hostility toward him and his family in Ibadan.3
Dike resigned as vice chancellor of Ibadan in December 1966 and returned to
Eastern Nigeria, where he served as vice chancellor of the University of Biafra
for a brief period. When the war broke out Dike was appointed by Ojukwu to be
a roving ambassador for Biafra. He and other roving ambassadors4 traveled
extensively throughout the world, speaking on behalf of the secessionist
republic. Dike was particularly effective in this role, and his appearances
attracted vigorous media attention. I remember reading several articles in the
Washington Post following his appearance at the National Press Club. One
article in particular, called “Biafra Explains Its Case” and published on April 13,
1969, was especially influential.
Before our time, Dike had already established an international reputation for
academic excellence as a historian. He taught at Harvard University after the war
as the first Mellon Professor of African History. In 1978, at the dawn of

Nigeria’s Second Republic, this towering international academic returned to
Nigeria to help set up the Anambra State University of Technology
(ASUTECH). It is a disservice to this wonderful man, to his achievements and
contribution to Nigeria’s development, that he died in 1983 from a blood
infection that would not have been difficult to cure had he stayed in the United
States!5
Vincent Chukwuemeka Ike also supported the Biafran cause and served the
Biafran people in several bureaucratic positions. Later, through prolific literary
output, Ike took a well-deserved place at the vanguard of the continent’s leading
novelists.
The literary harvest from Africa today owes a great debt to female African
intellectual forerunners. These griots, orators, and later writers played an
indispensable role in recording, molding, and transmitting the African story. By
boldly mixing numerous African and Western literary traditions in a cauldron,
seasoning them with local color, and spicing their tales with the complexity of
the human condition, modern women wordsmiths have deepened our
understanding of our world. Florence Nwanzuruahu Nwapa (Flora Nwapa)
belongs to this important school of African female literary progenitors.
Five years before the war, in 1962, Flora Nwapa informed me that she was
working on a manuscript to be called Efuru. After some editorial work, Efuru
was published in 1966, on the eve of the war, to great fanfare. It was a
monumental event, as it was, as far as I could tell, the first novel published by a
Nigerian woman. It was also important because it was a book ahead of its time,
with an assuredly feminist plot and perspective.6
Around the same period, as providence would have it, Alan Hill, the
publishing executive at Heinemann Publishers in England, asked me to become
the first editor of the African Writers Series. Alan and I, with James Currey and
a few others, developed a vision of gathering much of Africa’s literary talent
under this series rubric in order to showcase the best of postcolonial African
literature. We had a fascinating beginning, and ended up publishing Christopher
Okigbo from Nigeria, Ayi Kwei Armah from Ghana, al-Tayyib Salih from
Sudan,
from Kenya, Bessie Head from Botswana, Nadine
Gordimer from South Africa, and Nelson Mandela, along with several other
major African writers.7
Flora Nwapa aided the Biafran war effort in various capacities, and after the
conflict was over continued her service to her people in the Ministry of Health
and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Urban Development, and

the Ministry of Establishment. She is remembered for her bold efforts at
reconstructing many institutions that had been destroyed during the NigeriaBiafra War.8
It is important to point out that a number of writers were neutral and quietly,
as far as I could tell, apolitical during the conflict between Nigeria and Biafra.
They did not align themselves with or provide overt support to either belligerent
during the war. One such individual was Amos Tutuola, who was a talented
writer. His most famous novels, The Palm-Wine Drinkard, published in 1946,
and My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, in 1954, explore Yoruba traditions and
folklore. He received a great deal of criticism from Nigerian literary critics for
his use of “broken or Pidgin English.” Luckily for all of us, Dylan Thomas, the
Welsh poet and writer, was enthralled by Tutuola’s “bewitching literary prose”
and wrote glowing reviews that helped Tutuola’s work attain international
acclaim. I still believe that Tutuola’s critics in Nigeria missed the point. The
beauty of his tales was fantastical expression of a form of an indigenous Yoruba,
therefore African, magical realism. It is important to note that his books came
out several decades before the brilliant Gabriel García Márquez published his
own masterpieces of Latin American literature, such as One Hundred Years of
Solitude.
I first met Mabel Segun (nee Aig-Imoukhuede), another prominent literary
figure, who was in the second set of students admitted to University College,
Ibadan, around 1949. She was a bright and energetic student from Sabongida
Ora in Edo State. I was the editor of the university paper, the University Herald,
and when it came time to appoint a deputy editor and advertisement manager,
she was a natural choice. In 1965, African University Press, a formidable outfit
at the time, published her children’s book, My Father’s Daughter.
Bolanle Awe, Dr. Tai Solarin, S. J. Cookey, Gabriel Okara, Ola Rotimi, Ade
Ajayi, and Emmanuel Obiechina were other towering figures of that era who I
admired.

The Life and Work of Christopher Okigbo
I have written and been quoted elsewhere as saying that Christopher Ifekandu
Okigbo was the finest Nigerian poet of his generation, but I believe that as his
work becomes better and more widely known in the world, he will also be
recognized as one of the most remarkable anywhere in our time. For while other
poets wrote good poems, Okigbo conjured up for us an amazing, haunting,
poetic firmament of a wild and violent beauty.1 Forty years later I still stand by
that assessment.
Christopher and I kept in touch after we graduated from Government
College, Umuahia, and our friendship grew during our time at University
College, Ibadan. He studied the classics and took classes in Latin—a subject that
was not available at Government College, Umuahia. A rumor I heard at the time
was that a teacher at Yaba Higher College who had been Pius Okigbo’s teacher
(Christopher’s senior brother), Professor E. A. Cadle, had wanted Pius to study
classics, but Pius did not want to, and instead traveled to America to study
economics at Northwestern University. Pius later became arguably the
continent’s leading thinker in that field. By the time Christopher got to
University College, Ibadan, Professor Cadle was now a professor of the classics
and later dean of the Faculty of Arts. He persuaded Christopher to take a major
in the classics. Christopher did, although he had a myriad of other interests. He
was involved in all aspects of campus life and had a very active social calendar.
He was a member of every cultural, literary, intellectual and political
organization, club, and association. He and I were founding members of the
notable Mbari Club, which was led by Ulli Beier, our professor. Okigbo was also
the editor in chief of the University Weekly, the campus newspaper.
His legendary creative work was first noted at Umuahia, where the teachers
encouraged this budding talent. Later, at the University College, Ibadan, he
published a number of poems in Horn, the university magazine edited by J. P.
Clark. He also published his work in Wole Soyinka’s Black Orpheus and
Transition, and then produced a number of critically acclaimed poetry
collections, including the groundbreaking classics Heavens Gate and
Labyrinths.2

After graduation, his reputation as a talented intellectual spread like a
savannah bush fire. He was highly sought after. He rapidly ran up a list of jobs
that read like a manual of careers: civil servant, businessman, teacher, librarian,
publisher, industrialist, and soldier. I am told that Chike Momah, a professional
librarian, was somewhat scandalized when Okigbo announced that he was going
to Nsukka to be interviewed for a position in the library of the new university.
Reminded that he knew nothing about librarianship, Okigbo blithely replied that
he had bought a book on the subject, which he intended to read during the fourhundred-mile journey to the interview. And he got the job!3
Christopher could not enter or leave a room unremarked, yet he was not
extravagant in manner or appearance. There was something about him not easy
to define, a certain inevitability of drama and event. There was a day, back when
my family still lived in Lagos, when my wife, Christie, overheard some people
talking quite early in the morning on our patio. Startled and a bit frightened, she
wondered what was going on. A few minutes later she smelled the aroma of
food, and at this point her curiousity was piqued. “What was the cook doing so
early in the morning?” she thought out loud. She put on her robe and went to
find out. It turned out that it was Christopher Okigbo. There he was sitting on the
kitchen table with the food that the cook had prepared for him, munching away.
He had arrived very early in the morning, went to the “boys’ quarters,” and woke
up the cook, described what he wanted him to cook, and said, “Don’t tell them
anything.” That was quintessential Okigbo.
Christopher’s vibrancy and heightened sense of life touched everyone he
came into contact with. It is not surprising, therefore, that the young poet Kevin
Echeruo should have celebrated him as an Ogbanje—one of those mysterious,
elusive, and highly talented beings who hurry to leave the world and to come
again. Equally profound was the fact that Pol Ndu, who died in a road disaster he
had predicted every gory detail of in a poem five years earlier, proclaimed
Christopher a seer.4
Christopher never took antimalarial drugs, because he rather enjoyed the
cozy, delirious fever he had when malaria got him down, about once a year. He
relished challenges, and the more unusual or difficult, the better it made him
feel. Although he turned his hand to many things, he never did anything badly or
half-heartedly.5

—

The experiences of the Igbo community from the pogroms onward had different
effects on different people. There were a multitude of reactions—anger, loathing,
sorrow, concern, depression, etc. These sentiments in Christopher’s case
somehow transformed into a very strong pro-Biafra feeling. He had no doubt at
all in his mind about Biafra and the need for the country to be a free and separate
nation. That strong stance was something new for Christopher.
The intensity of Christopher’s dedication to the Biafran cause was so deep
that I remember hearing him get into a raucous debate with his elder brother
Pius.6 Apparently the cause of the flare-up of emotions was a discussion about
Biafran sovereignty and its importance for the Easterners, particularly the Igbo,
to create a state of their own and secede from the federal republic of Nigeria.
Pius Okigbo was not, at least initially, very strong in his support of the idea of
separation. This position outraged the much younger Christopher, who rebuked
Pius by saying: “Don’t let what happened to Ironsi repeat itself,” implying that
Pius, in his determination to preserve One Nigeria, should be careful not to be
destroyed by Nigeria like Ironsi was during the time he was trying to appease
extremists. Pius was so shocked by the rebuke that he turned to me, raised his
hands in disbelief, and said, “Uncle Chris!”7 in a sarcastic tone. Pius Okigbo was
a very senior economist and part of the diplomatic corps representing Nigeria in
several capacities, so he was a bit wary about what was going on in the East, and
in Nigeria as a whole, and rightfully so. Later, as the atrocities against the Igbos
in particular intensified, Pius Okigbo’s position solidified squarely on Biafra’s
side. At that point the pressure of war was being felt. Now unbeknownst to us,
Christopher had joined the army. Whereas I did not find the army particularly
exciting or interesting, for whatever reason Okigbo was enthralled by the
military. He would keep you up at night telling stories of what Nzeogwu and the
other officers said.8
When Okigbo decided to join the army he went to great lengths to conceal
his intention from me, for fear, no doubt, that I might attempt to dissuade him. I
probably would have tried. He made up an elaborate story about an imminent
and secret mission he was asked to undertake to Europe that put me totally off
the scent. But to make absolutely certain, he borrowed my traveling bag and left
his brown briefcase with me. When I saw him again two weeks later he was a
major, by special commission, in the Biafran army, though I never saw him in
uniform.9

The Major Nigerian Actors in the Conflict:
Ojukwu and Gowon
A number of individuals played key roles during the Nigeria-Biafra War.1 The
principal actors in 1967, however, were both young Sandhurst-trained soldiers—
Odumegwu Ojukwu, who was thirty-three, and Yakubu Gowon, who was thirtytwo. One was from a highly privileged background and the other was the socalled darling of the British establishment.2

THE ARISTOCRAT
General Chukwuemeka (Emeka) Odumegwu Ojukwu was born on November 4,
1933, in Zungeru, in Northern Nigeria, to Sir Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu and
Grace Oyibonanu. The senior Ojukwu was already a legendary figure while I
was growing up in Eastern Nigeria, known far and wide for his great wealth and
success in business. Indeed, by midcentury Sir Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu had
established himself as one of West Africa’s leading entrepreneurs, with business
interests spanning several sectors of the Nigerian and West African economies—
agriculture, mining, transportation, and banking.
Sir Louis Ojukwu at some time or other sat on the boards of a number of the
largest corporations of the time—Shell BP, United Africa Company (UAC),
Nigerian Coal Corporation, and African Continental Bank. For his services to
the empire, Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II
during her official visit to Enugu in 1956.
It was in this privileged environment that General Emeka Ojukwu was
raised. Like a number of other children of privilege, Ojukwu was educated at
one of the leading secondary schools in the nation, King’s College, Lagos. Later
he was sent to Epsom College, England, and then on to Lincoln College—
University of Oxford.3
When Emeka Ojukwu returned to Nigeria after his studies in England, he
spent a short time “finding himself.” Against the wishes of his father, who
wanted him to attend law school and join the family business in some capacity,

the young Ojukwu decided to first work in the Eastern Nigeria civil service as an
assistant district officer (ADO). Then, in a move likely designed to enrage his
father even further, the young Ojukwu joined the colonial armed forces known
as the Queen’s Own Nigeria Regiment. Emeka Ojukwu’s decision caused quite a
sensation at the time, because most educated Nigerians, particularly those of
privileged birth like him, sought jobs in the business, academic, or civil service
sectors, but not in the army. The Nigerian army did have educated officers, but
they were few in number.
Emeka Ojukwu went back to England to attend the Royal Military Academy
Sandhurst and returned shortly after to Nigeria, where he joined the officer corps
and rapidly rose through the military ranks. He was accorded a great deal of
respect by his military colleagues, who admired his pedigree and education.4
Frederick Forsyth, Ojukwu’s close friend, who would become a close Biafran
ally during the war, reports of his days in England: “[H]e developed a private
philosophy of total self-reliance, an unyielding internal sufficiency that requires
no external support from others.”5 This trait would bring Ojukwu in direct
collision with some senior Biafrans, such as Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Michael
Okpara, Dr. Okechukwu Ikejiani, and a few others who were concerned about
Ojukwu’s tendency toward introversion and independent decision making.
Emeka Ojukwu received a mixed reception among the expatriate, mainly
British, population in Nigeria. Many admired him for his background, as well as
for his oratorical skills, and took great pride in the fact that he had been educated
extensively in England. There is a magnificent story of how Emeka Ojukwu’s
professors at Oxford enjoyed taking a spin or two in his sports car while he was
a student there. Others, in contrast, felt that Ojukwu was some sort of spoiled
rich kid. This impression made it more difficult for him to be cast as a
sympathetic figure in the Western media when the war broke out. Complicating
this image problem was the fact that some important wartime actors and
observers, such as Sir David Hunt, the British ambassador to Nigeria during the
conflict, and the eminent British journalist John de St. Jorre, believed Ojukwu
looked down on Gowon. Ojukwu felt, they believed, that as an Oxford man he
was far better prepared for leadership.6 Those of us who knew Ojukwu did not
feel he harbored such sentiments. Whatever the case may be, Ojukwu’s
background and temperament, for good or ill, influenced the decisions and
choices that he made throughout the crisis and during much of what many
believed was “a personal war and collision of egos”7 with Gowon.

THE GENTLEMAN GENERAL
Yakubu Gowon was born on October 19, 1934, in Pankshin, Plateau State, under
circumstances very different from those of his military nemesis Emeka Ojukwu.
Yakubu Gowon’s parents were Christian missionaries. His family spent several
years during his early development in Zaria in Hausa land, where he received his
early education and learned to speak the language of the dominant Hausa/Fulani
fluently.8 Yakubu Gowon then received military training in Ghana and Eaton
Hall in England before proceeding to the legendary officer training school in
Sandhurst. “He then attended Young Officers’ College, Hythe Warminster, in
1957, Staff College, Camberley, England (1962), and Joint Services College,
Latimer, England (1965).”9 He returned to Nigeria soon thereafter and became a
star officer; his ability to assimilate would serve him well as he advanced rapidly
in the Nigerian army.
Alexander Madiebo recounts the perception of Gowon’s contemporaries in
the army:
Gowon for unknown reasons has always been very popular with the British
authorities, both during his training in Britain and throughout his military service in
Nigeria. For this reason, his progress in the army was so remarkable and extraordinary
that even his fellow Northern officers were beginning to grumble. For instance, when
he was chosen to attend the Camberley Staff College, England in January 1962, Major
Pam, a Jos [Joint Service] Officer senior to him, called him a “sneaky sucker.”10

Yakubu Gowon was a particular favorite of the queen and other members of
Britain’s royal family, a fact that he relished immensely.11 “[He] impressed the
British monarchy as a sincere God-fearing leader who was determined to work
for the development of his country under conditions of international peace and
stability.” He did not fail to impress Britain’s cousins across the Atlantic either,
at any opportunity. Henry Luce, the wealthy and highly influential American
publisher of Time magazine, found Gowon
[a] spit-and-polish product of Britain’s Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Gowon
is sometimes dismissed as “Jack the Boy Scout” in Lagos diplomatic circles. He
neither smokes nor drinks, and keeps his 5-ft. 10-in. frame trim at 140 lbs.12

Whether or not one can ascribe this resentment held by his fellow officers
toward Gowon to soldiers’ envy isn’t clear, but what was evident was that
Gowon was a charismatic, eloquent, personable soldier who utilized a number of
his skills to impress the rich and powerful. General Aguiyi-Ironsi, who became
Nigeria’s first military head of state following the failed coup d’état of January

15, 1966, was one of many who were fond of Gowon, and the general appointed
him chief of army staff. While I was watching events unfold in Nigeria in 1966, I
found it instructive that when Ironsi was killed in the counter–coup d’état of
young Northern officers on July 29, 1966, it was Yakubu Gowon who was
chosen to become head of the federal military government and commander in
chief of the armed forces.
Gowon’s elevation to head of state was a tactical compromise to assuage
most ethnic groups that Nigeria was not coming under an Islamic Hausa/Fulani
leadership intent on Christian and Southern domination. It did not help matters
that many officers did not feel that Gowon was the most qualified to be in the
role of head of state. In the Nigerian Outlook of March 21, 1967, Ojukwu
revealed the sentiments of many military officers in Eastern Nigeria:
The point here and the crux of the whole matter is the fact that the North wants to
dominate. . . . Gowon is not capable of doing anything. He is only a front man for the
whole NPC/NNDP coalition. . . . [I]n fact the officers and men who took part in the
July massacre were being used as tools. . . . But the NNDP/NPC coalition which
master-minded this pogrom definitely wanted to continue the old policy of the North,
that is to dominate and dictate.13

Behind the scenes, Murtala Muhammed was nursing his wounds. It was
well-known that Muhammed, a favorite son of the Muslim Hausa/Fulani military
establishment, was initially tapped to be head of state—an idea that was quickly
shelved in favor of Gowon, the charismatic Christian and ethnic minority
candidate from Plateau State. This snub was not lost on Muhammed, who
harbored an unrelenting resentment toward Gowon and would later, in 1975,
mount the decisive coup that ousted him from office.
In what was widely seen as an attempt to soothe growing ethnic hostility,
particularly in Eastern Nigeria, Gowon appointed Emeka Ojukwu, a fellow
Sandhurst alumnus, to the post of military governor of the Eastern Region, a post
similar to that which he had held within Aguiyi-Ironsi’s Supreme Military
Council. It was said that Emeka Ojukwu served in this new capacity reluctantly,
because of what he believed was Gowon’s unclear role in the coup that led to the
assassination of General Aguiyi-Ironsi and nearly two hundred Igbo officers.
The relationship between the two men, shaky from the start of Gowon’s new
government, suffered several other setbacks in the months to come, particularly
following the series of pogroms that left over thirty thousand Easterners, mainly
Igbo, murdered, and nearly one million fleeing to their ancestral homes in
1966.14

—
There are a number who believe that neither Gowon nor Ojukwu were the right
leaders for that desperate time, because they were blinded by ego, hindered by a
lack of administrative experience, and obsessed with interpersonal competition
and petty rivalries.15 As a consequence, according to this school of thought, these
two men failed to make appropriate and wise decisions throughout the conflict
and missed several opportunities when compromise could have saved the day.16
No small number of international political science experts found the NigeriaBiafra War baffling, because it deviated frustratingly from their much vaunted
models. But traditional Igbo philosophers, eyes ringed with white chalk and
tongues dipped in the proverbial brew of prophecy, lay the scale and complexity
of our situation at the feet of ethnic hatred and ekwolo—manifold rivalries
between the belligerents. Internal rivalries, one discovers, between personalities,
across ethnic groups, and within states, often fuel the persistence of conflicts.17
Conflicts are not just more likely to last longer as a result of these rivalries but
are also more likely to recur, with alternating periods of aggression and peace of
shorter and shorter duration.18 A “lock-in period”—the intensification of war
with ever-shortening times of peace—is also classically seen.19
The internal rivalries that existed between Gowon and Ojukwu, and the
pathological intraethnic dynamics that plagued the Nigerian military and
wartime government, contributed in no small measure to the scale of the
catastrophe that was the Nigeria-Biafra War. The fractured respect and
unenthusiastic reception Gowon received following his ascendancy to the
position of head of state was only the beginning. There was a stifling anger at the
dissolution of the Nigerian state, with all its ramifications. These sentiments
were borne particularly by the Easterners overlooked by the young general at the
helm of Nigerian affairs, with disastrous consequences.
There are a few other factors that merit consideration. There was an
obsessive tendency by both belligerents—Gowon and Ojukwu—to seek
positions of strength and avoid looking weak throughout the conflict. I am not
referring to the propaganda statements, however over the top, which one expects
in times of war, but to the ego-driven policies that were clearly not about the
conflict at hand. Some of Ojukwu’s and Gowon’s civilian advisers aggravated
the crisis by transforming themselves into sycophants. Rather than encourage
their respective leader on each side of the conflict to consider a cease-fire, they
massaged their egos and spurred them on to ever-escalating hostility.20

The longer the war dragged on, the more difficult it was for both sides to
give in to anything that might lead to a peaceful resolution. In Biafra there was a
widely held belief that “a cease-fire would lead to genocide or retribution of
equal magnitude, or at least the relinquishing of self-determination and
freedom.” Biafrans widely believed that the gap between our ideological
position and that of our Nigerian brethren had simply grown too wide to
bridge.21 Complicating matters was the fact that most intellectuals in Biafra
viewed Nigeria, now under military dictatorship, as a neocolonial state under the
iron grasp of its former colonial master, Great Britain, with a very willing
steward at the helm.
There are some scholars who believe that the Igbo turned to Emeka Ojukwu
by virtue of the fact that he was the governor of the Eastern Region of Nigeria at
the time of the crisis—the “man in power” theory. Others have gone as far as to
suggest that the war would have been prevented if there was a leader other than
Ojukwu in place. The first statement will be debated for generations. As for the
second, I believe that following the pogroms, or rather, the ethnic cleansing in
the North that occurred over the four months starting in May 1966, which was
compounded by the involvement, even connivance, of the federal government in
those evil and dastardly acts, secession from Nigeria and the war that followed
became an inevitability.
To be sure, there were a number that harbored alternative points of view. One
of those people was the distinguished diplomat Raph Uwechue, who served as
Biafra’s envoy to Paris up until 1968, and then later as Nigeria’s ambassador to
Mali. Uwechue published a well-known personal memoir called Reflections on
the Nigerian Civil War: Facing the Future in 1969, in which he unleashed a
scathing criticism of Ojukwu and the leadership he provided for Biafra:
In Biafra two wars were fought simultaneously. The first was for the survival of the
Ibos [sic] as a race. The second was for the survival of Ojukwu’s leadership. Ojukwu’s
error, which proved fatal for millions of Ibos [sic], was that he put the latter first.22

Many who share Uwechue’s point of view cite as an example Ojukwu’s
refusal to accept $600,000 from the British for relief supplies; they see this as
evidence of a beleaguered albeit committed adversary who made ideological
rather than practical or pragmatic decisions. Uwechue’s conclusions about the
Biafran people are, however, far more controversial, in my opinion:
The Biafran masses, enslaved by an extremely efficient propaganda network and
cowed by the iron grip of a ruthless military machine, had neither the facts nor the
liberty to form an independent opinion. The case of the elite was different. . . . Those

who had access to the facts knew that the time had come to seek a realistic way to end
the war. . . . In private they expressed this view but proved too cowardly to take a
stand and tell Ojukwu the truth.23

The late Senator Francis Ellah, a close friend of mine who helped set up the
Biafran mission in London, and then served Biafra in several capacities,
provides much more of a middle-ground analysis. He does, however, come down
on the side of the many who believed that the Biafrans, not just the Nigerians,
missed a number of opportunities to compromise and end the war earlier than
they did:
I think the circumstances that led to Biafra were very unique; I remember that when I
heard news of the secession on the radio I almost broke down . . . the causes were
quite traumatic. I think once secession had been declared, the efforts made to fight the
war were staggering. We were highly impressed by the solidarity shown by the
Eastern Region. Then we had a cause we were fighting for.
I think that around March 1968, when we were in a position to achieve a
confederation, we should have accepted the chance or opportunity. When we were
insisting that Biafran sovereignty was not negotiable, as the government thought at the
time, we ought to have considered the tragedy of the situation, because this country
would have been much better if we had a confederation of four to six states, other than
what we have now. Around the time of the Kampala talks there were definite signs
that a confederation could be achieved. The Biafran side was adamant on the fact of
sovereignty being nonnegotiable.24

THE FIRST SHOT
That lone rifle-shot anonymous
in the dark striding chest-high
through a nervous suburb at the break
of our season of thunders will yet
steep its flight and lodge
more firmly than the greater noises
ahead in the forehead of memory.1

The Biafran Invasion of the Mid-West
The Nigeria-Biafra War began soon after Emeka Ojukwu’s proclamation of
secession. Gowon decided to first use the federal army’s First Command in what
he termed a “police action,”1 in an attempt to “restore federal government
authority in Lagos and the break-away Eastern region.” The move to capture the
Biafran border towns of Ogoja and Nsukka proved to be a declaration of war.
Following this, in July 1967, Nigerian troops attempted to cross the Niger Bridge
into Biafra. The Biafran army was able to halt its advance and disperse them.2
That Biafran response became an advance, leading to the taking of a large
swath of the Mid-Western Region in a surprise maneuver that the Nigerian
federal troops had not anticipated. Ojukwu explained his ambitious plan this
way:
Our motive was not territorial ambition or the desire of conquest. We went into the
Midwest (later declared the Republic of Benin) purely in an effort to seize the serpent
by the head; every other activity in that Republic was subordinated to that single aim.
We were going to Lagos to seize the villain Gowon, and we took necessary military
precautions.3

Despite the euphoric verbal heroics espoused by Ojukwu, John de St. Jorre,
the well-regarded reporter for The Observer, provided a far more subdued
picture of Biafran army readiness and organization:
The Biafrans “stormed” through the Mid-West not in the usual massive impedimenta
of modern warfare but in a bizarre collection of private cars, “mammy” wagons, cattle
and vegetable trucks. The command vehicle was a Peugeot 404 estate car. The whole
operation was not carried out by an “army” or even a “brigade” . . . but by at most
1,000 men, the majority poorly trained and armed, and many wearing civilian clothes
because they had not been issued with uniforms.4

In the days preceding the Biafran invasion I was informed by friends and
relatives who lived in the Mid-West Region5 that the air there was rife with
rumors of an impending federal takeover to provide it with strategic and
logistical access to Eastern Nigeria if war broke out. The leading political and
traditional leaders of the Mid-West had made it clear to Gowon that they wanted
no part of a civil war and that the region would be neutral in the event of any
hostilities. There were several reasons for this position. Apart from a desire for

peace during a precarious period, the leaders of that part of Nigeria recognized
that their citizens were of a multiethnic background, including a sizable Igbo
population.
The Biafrans utilized this knowledge in mapping out their strategy. The
leaders of the offensive related their reasons for occupying the Mid-West as one
“organized to prevent the Federal Government from ‘forcing Mid Westerners to
enlist to fight against their own people,’ thus undermining the mediatory role
which the Mid-West had been playing.” Indeed, some scholars speculate that
Governor David Ejoor, the military governor of the Mid-West, was informed of
Ojukwu’s intention to invade and that both men could have very well met to
discuss the implications of such an action.6
Brigadier Victor Banjo was one of the masterminds7 of this successful
Biafran offensive. Ojukwu had released Banjo, a Nigerian soldier who had
allegedly taken part in the January 15 coup d’état and was detained in Ikot
Ekpene Prison. Banjo had been found guilty of treason by the Nigerian federal
government despite his insistence of innocence. He decided to stay on Biafran
soil after secession rather than return and face court-martial. Ojukwu got tactical,
strategic, and political mileage from having Banjo in Biafra, and he enjoyed the
prospect of having a Nigerian soldier fight for him. Against protests in certain
Biafran military quarters, Ojukwu brought Victor Banjo into the statehouse at
Enugu as one of his close military confidants and advisers. Victor Banjo, it was
widely known, was not in favor of Ojukwu’s secessionist aspirations but favored
a solution to Nigeria’s problems that would result in the “deamalgamation” of
the country back into Southern and Northern Nigeria.8
In the late evening of August 14, 1967, soon after the Biafrans invaded the
Mid-Western Region, Brigadier Banjo spoke to Mid-Westerners and Nigerians
over the airwaves from Benin. Hundreds of thousands of listeners across the
nation tuned in, expecting a detailed explanation for the invasion and a
description of the long-term plans of the Biafran army. Some of the questions
running through my mind and the minds of many Nigerians across the nation
included the following: Who exactly was behind this invasion? Was this a
temporary occupation? What was the long-term plan? What would be the
reaction of Gowon and the Nigerian federal forces?
Banjo’s address was a disappointment. It sounded to me far more like a
lament of the breakup of Nigeria than a speech coming from “a Biafran military
leader” or an explanation for the invasion of Nigerian territory or Biafran
secession.

Banjo dedicated the first half of his message to what sounded like an
overview of Nigeria’s political and military history and his own travails within
that establishment. In the second half of the speech he finally got around to
explaining to his listeners that the Biafran invasion was “not a conquest . . . or an
invasion” but an exercise designed to “enable the people of the Mid-West to see
the Nigerian problem in its proper perspective.” Banjo appealed to all civil
servants to return to work the very next day and assured them of their safety. In a
veiled threat, he warned those who failed to comply that they would lose their
jobs.9
Closely following Banjo’s speech was the promulgation by the Biafrans of a
new decree that established what would be known as the Republic of Benin (the
area occupied by Biafran forces in the Mid-Western Region) and the
appointment of Major Albert Nwazu Okonkwo as its military administrator.
Okonkwo’s administration, we were told, would supersede the previous
government of the military governor, David Ejoor, who had been appointed by
the Nigerian head of state.
Major Okonkwo found his brief, some might say draconian, rule—he
imposed martial law, curfews, and limited accessibility—punctuated by
insurrections and burdened by the assaults of organized underground resistance
groups. Many Mid-Westerners passed along to me accounts of their conflicting
feelings after the Biafran offensive: “We, on the one hand, were being told by the
Biafran propaganda machinery that we were being liberated from tyranny, but on
the other [we were] feeling like an occupied military zone under martial law.”10
There was also growing discontent among the Biafran soldiers who were
only there on military assignment but increasingly found themselves targets of
local hostility. There were reports of Biafran troops seeking medical treatment
for food poisoning suffered at the hands of cooks who had been recruited from
the surrounding “occupied areas.” The Biafran soldiers were under siege from
several fronts.11
According to civil war lore, Ojukwu was livid upon learning about the
contents of Banjo’s speech to Mid-Westerners following Biafra’s takeover
because it did not “sufficiently demonstrate solidarity with his own secessionist
aspirations to leave Nigeria.”12 Ojukwu apparently also had been told that Banjo
was complicit in a plot that enabled David Ejoor—the erstwhile military
governor of the Mid-Western Region—to escape from the clutches of the Biafran
forces. This made it possible, the allegations continued, for Ejoor to meet with
the federal government in Lagos and provide the Nigerian head of state with

critical military and tactical information about the Biafran offensive. It was also
alleged that Banjo failed on purpose to continue the surprise offensive as
planned beyond Ore in the Mid-West to Nigeria’s administrative capital, Lagos,
and largest commercial city, Ibadan, after direct contact with agents of the
federal government and Yoruba leaders.13 Banjo’s detractors, who never trusted
him in the first place, had by this time successfully labeled him a traitor and an
enemy of the state of Biafra.
In 1982, Ojukwu provided a glimpse of his disappointment about the role
that Banjo played in the Mid-West offensive: “The stop in Benin was the
beginning of the error. . . . My plan for that operation was that by half past five
in the morning, the Biafran troops would be in the peripheries of Lagos.”14
A counterpoint can be obtained from the Nigerian general Olusegun
Obasanjo’s memoir My Command: An Account of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967–
1970. In it Obasanjo creates some doubts as to whether or not Victor Banjo
intentionally refused to proceed farther to Ibadan and Lagos as directed: “A
renowned social critic . . . and [I] discussed Banjo’s request for me to grant him
unhindered access to Ibadan and Lagos at any price. Both the request and the
price were turned down.”
So did Banjo, without Ojukwu’s consent, make a tactical decision not to
proceed beyond Ore after the military intelligence available to him demonstrated
that it could be a suicide mission? Was Victor Banjo a traitor or a misunderstood
hero? I think posterity will debate this question for a long time, because Banjo
was subsequently executed by Ojukwu and did not leave written documents to
prove or disprove his innocence.15

Gowon Regroups
Following the Biafran invasion of the Mid-West, Gowon reorganized his war
strategy. He placed some of his best military personnel in three key roles as part
of his agenda to “crush the Biafrans.” Mohammed Shuwa was commander in
charge of the First Division of the federal army. His orders were to advance from
Northern Nigeria with his troops to take the Biafran towns of Nsukka and
Ogoja.1 Colonel Murtala Muhammed, in charge of Division Two, had marching
orders to retake Benin and the other parts of the Mid-West occupied by the
Biafran army, and then cross the River Niger into Onitsha. Finally, Division
Three of the Nigerian army, led by Benjamin Adekunle (aka “the black
scorpion”), would commandeer a southern offensive.2 Three months later the
Nigerian forces, now more organized and “armed to the teeth” with British
weapons, had staged a successful counteroffensive. The Biafrans were now in
full retreat.3
The Nigerian army pushed back the Biafrans and arrived at the outskirts of
“the Republic of Benin” in September 1967, led by Murtala Muhammed. His
Second Infantry Division mounted a resurgent attack from two
fronts���defending their advance and pushing forward in a classic “Greek
army offensive.”4 The retreating Biafran forces, according to several accounts,
allegedly beat up a number of Mid-Westerners who they believed had served as
saboteurs. Nigerian radio reports claimed that the Biafrans shot a number of
innocent civilians as they fled the advancing federal forces.5 As disturbing as
these allegations are, I have found no credible corroboration of them.

The Asaba Massacre
The federal forces were soon able to snatch Benin from Biafran military hands
and advance quickly toward the River Niger, arriving in Asaba in early October
1967. There are multiple versions of what transpired in Asaba. The version I
heard amounted to this: Murtala Muhammed—chief commander (GOC)
Division Two—and his lieutenants, including Colonel Ibrahim Haruna, felt
humiliated by the Biafran Mid-Western offensive. Armed with direct orders to
retake the occupied areas at all costs, this division rounded up and shot as many
defenseless Igbo men and boys as they could find. Some reports place the death
toll at five hundred, others as high as one thousand.1
The Asaba Massacre, as it would be known, was only one of many such
postpogrom atrocities committed by Nigerian soldiers during the war. It became
a particular abomination for Asaba residents, as many of those killed were titled
Igbo chiefs and common folk alike, and their bodies were disposed of with
reckless abandon in mass graves, without regard to the wishes of the families of
the victims or the town’s ancient traditions.2
His Holiness Pope Paul VI, having received no commitments from either the
Nigerians or the Biafrans for a cease-fire, sent his emissary, the well-regarded
Monsignor Georges Rocheau, to Nigeria on a fact-finding mission. The horrified
Roman Catholic priest spoke to the French newspaper Le Monde following the
visit, recounting what he witnessed:
There has been genocide, for example on the occasion of the 1966 massacres. . . . Two
areas have suffered badly [from the fighting]. Firstly the region between the towns of
Benin and Asaba where only widows and orphans remain, Federal troops having for
unknown reasons massacred all the men.3

General Gowon broke his silence thirty-five years later on this matter and
apologized for this atrocity to the Igbos in Asaba:
It came to me as a shock when I came to know about the unfortunate happenings that
happened to the sons and daughters . . . of [Asaba] domain. I felt very touched and
honestly I referred to [the killings] and ask for forgiveness being the one who was in
charge at that time. Certainly, it is not something that I would have approved of in
whatsoever. I was made ignorant of it, I think until it appeared in the papers. A young
man wrote a book at that time.4

Testifying at the Justice Oputa Panel (a Nigerian version of South Africa’s
Truth and Reconciliation Commission), Major General Ibrahim Haruna,
belligerent and unremorseful as ever, proclaimed:
As the commanding officer and leader of the troops that massacred 500 men in Asaba,
I have no apology for those massacred in Asaba, Owerri, and Ameke-Item. I acted as
a soldier maintaining the peace and unity of Nigeria. . . . If General Yakubu Gowon
apologized, he did it in his own capacity. As for me I have no apology.5

Murtala Muhammed advanced quickly following the abomination in Asaba
to cross the Niger River Bridge to Onitsha. Muhammed’s federal troops
sustained many casualties in that guerrilla warfare, and from sniper attacks by
Achuzia’s Biafran troops, and they failed to take the market town in the first
attempt.

Biafran Repercussions
The exhausted, fleeing Biafran soldiers crossed the River Niger and arrived in
Enugu, Biafra’s capital. Their actions had unanticipated consequences. Ojukwu,
nursing the wounds of, as he saw it, a “self-inflicted defeat,” summarily courtmartialed the leaders of the exercise. The accused men—Brigadier Victor Banjo,
Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna, Sam Agbamuche, and Major Phillip Alale—were
found guilty of planning a coup d’état to overthrown Ojukwu’s regime, a
treasonable felony punishable by death. All four men were executed on
September 25, 1967.1
It is important to point out that at the time Enugu had a conspiratorial
atmosphere, and some in Ojukwu’s inner circle added fuel to the fire. There was
talk of alleged plots to overthrow the government. Rumors swirled that Major
Ifeajuna, a mastermind of the January 15, 1966, coup, was spotted by Biafran
intelligence in covert meetings with British secret service agents. Others alleged
that the British had paid Victor Banjo a large commission—to the tune of several
thousand pounds—to bungle the Mid-Western advance. Such was the climate of
fear and paranoia.2

Blood, Blood, Everywhere
The Biafrans found themselves under heavy assault after the Mid-West
offensive. Mohammed Shuwa’s First Army Division, advancing with Theophilus
Danjuma, quickly overran the university town of Nsukka, and then relentlessly
bombarded Biafra’s capital with heavy armaments. The military operation was
aided by Egyptian mercenary pilots flying the Nigerian army’s brand-new
British, Czech L-29 Delphins, and Soviet MiG-17 and Ilyushin Beagle II-28
aircraft. Most of us in the civilian population had fled with family members into
the hinterlands, ahead of the advancing Nigerian troops. By the second week of
October 1967, overwhelmed by the Nigerian military pounding, the Biafran
central government also receded southward, to Umuahia, where a new capital
was set up.1
By now the world had started taking notice, and a number of international
organizations were visiting Nigeria to try to broker a peace between the two
warring parties. One of the first to intervene was the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), which appointed Ghanaian lieutenant general Joseph Arthur
Ankrah their emissary to Biafra. Ankrah had some experience with the conflict,
having hosted the Aburi meeting in January. Many Biafrans, myself included,
had mixed feelings about the OAU’s choice, as Ankrah, widely regarded as “a
Cold War pawn,” was the man responsible for deposing one of the heroes of the
African liberation struggle—Kwame Nkrumah. It was little surprise to those of
us in Biafra, therefore, to discover that under his guidance the OAU supported “a
unified Nigeria” stance despite Biafra’s protests.

The Calabar Massacre
The Nigerian forces overran Calabar in early 1968 without much resistance or
investment. A seat of the ancient kingdom of the same name, Calabar is in the
southeastern part of Biafra, on the banks of the majestic Calabar River. It had for
decades been a melting pot of Easterners—Efik, Ibibio, Igbo, and others—that
had produced a beautiful cultural mosaic of traditions and dialects.
In actions reminiscent of the Nazi policy of eradicating Jews throughout
Europe just twenty years earlier, the Nigerian forces decided to purge the city of
its Igbo inhabitants.1 By the time the Nigerians were done they had “shot at least
1,000 and perhaps 2,000 Ibos [sic], most of them civilians.”2 There were other
atrocities, throughout the region. “In Oji River,” The Times of London reported
on August 2, 1968, “the Nigerian forces opened fire and murdered fourteen
nurses and the patients in the wards.”3 In Uyo and Okigwe more innocent lives
were lost to the brutality and blood lust of the Nigerian soldiers.4
In April 1968, the Nigerians decided to mount a major strategic and tactical
offensive designed to cut Biafra off from the seacoast. The over forty thousand
troops of the Third Division, lead by army colonel Benjamin Adekunle, engaged
in an amphibious, land, and air onslaught on the Niger River Delta city of Port
Harcourt. After several weeks of sustained air, land, and sea pounding, a period
reportedly characterized by military atrocities—rapes, looting, outright
brigandry—Port Harcourt fell to the Nigerians on May 12, 1968.
The Third Division slowly marched north, crossing the Imo River, toward
the market town of Aba. With heavy casualties along the way, Adekunle and his
men shot gleefully through a fierce Biafran resistance and took Aba in August
and Owerri in September. The Aba offensive was particularly gruesome:
On entry into Aba, the Nigerian soldiers massacred more than 2000 civilians. Susan
Masid of the French Press Agency reporting this horrifying incident had this to say:
“Young Ibos [sic] with terrifying eyes and trembling lips told journalists in Aba that in
the villages Nigerian troops came from behind, shooting and firing everywhere,
shooting everybody who was running, firing into the homes.” (Emphases in original.)5

Colonel Adekunle, no doubt a Nigerian war hero, had by now earned a
reputation, at least in Biafran quarters, for cruelty and sadism. After a number of

provocative public statements illustrating his zeal for warfare, coupled with
verbal clashes with international journalists and observer teams, Adekunle
became the subject of the local and international spotlight. I was told, away from
the media glare, that his conduct became a source of embarrassment for
Gowon’s wartime cabinet.
Perhaps Adekunle’s most heinous statement during the war was this:
“[Biafran aid is] ‘misguided humanitarian rubbish. . . . If children must die first,
then that is too bad, just too bad.’”6 That statement caused such an international
uproar that the federal government of Nigeria found itself in the unenviable
position of having to apologize for the actions not only of Adekunle but also of
Haruna, leader of the Asaba Massacre infamy. Unbeknownst to Adekunle, a
quiet retirement from the Nigerian army was in the offing.7
I have often thought of the man who returns after an “operation”—this is what it is
called, an “operation”—and has a wash and goes into the bar of his hotel and drinks
whiskey. He has been on an “operation,” and on the other side you have maybe 120
people cut to pieces. A friend of mine had his three children—just like that, they went
out to buy books—five minutes later, it was over—it does not take long—10 seconds.
It is quite frightening.8

Meanwhile, on the northeastern front, Mohammed Shuwa’s First Division easily
overran Abakaliki and Afikpo.9 Umuahia was the only major urban area in the
secessionist republic that had not been overtaken by the Nigerians.
Gowon rapidly increased the size of his army to well over a quarter of a
million men and women. His final offensive, which would be mounted on the
three fronts that surrounded the Biafrans, was supposed to end the war swiftly, in
three months. As he advanced for what he thought was to be a final push to
claim a Biafran surrender in September 1968, he was met by fierce Biafran
resistance—sniper fire and guerrilla warfare.10 Several unanticipated events
coalesced to form a perfect storm that bought the exhausted Biafran army much
needed time to regroup, repair the much damaged Uli airstrip, and develop a
defensive strategy. Antiwar sentiment worldwide was reaching a peak.
Bombarded constantly with war imagery through their television sets and
newspapers, particularly pictures of babies and women perishing and starving,
several individuals and international human rights agencies started mounting
demonstrations in world capitals—London, Washington, Lisbon—against the
war.

Jean-Paul Sartre and François Mauriac in France11 and John Lennon in
London made public statements condemning the war. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
long a champion of universal justice, had to suddenly cancel his planned trip to
Nigeria over fears for his safety. Joan Baez and Jimi Hendrix were some of the
famous musicians who took part in a Biafran relief concert in Manhattan, on
August 29, 1968. Other British and American artists led peaceful protests of
song to draw American public attention to the conflict. The newscasters in
America were mesmerized by the story of a young college student, Bruce
Mayrock, who set himself on fire to protest the killing of “innocent Biafran
babies.” Mayrock, sadly, later died in the hospital from his wounds. It was
reported that he wanted to draw the attention of the media, delegates in session
at the United Nations, and United States government officials to what he
believed was genocide in Biafra.12 Henry Kissinger, now under heavy pressure
from civil society groups, found himself encouraging the Nixon administration
to rethink their policy on the Nigeria-Biafra conflict.13

BIAFRA, 1969
First time Biafra
Was here, we’re told, it was a fine
Figure massively hewn in hardwood.
Voracious white ants
Set upon it and ate
Through its huge emplaced feet
To the great heart abandoning
A furrowed, emptied scarecrow.
And sun-stricken waves came and beat crazily
About its feet eaten hollow
Till crashing facedown in a million fragments
It was floated gleefully away
To cold shores—cartographers alone
Marking the coastline
Of that forgotten massive stance.
In our time it came again
In pain and acrid smell
Of powder. And furious wreckers
Emboldened by half a millennium
Of conquest, battering
On new oil dividends, are now
At its black throat squeezing
Blood and lymph down to
Its hands and feet
Bloated by quashiokor.
Must Africa have

To come a third time?1

The Republic of Biafra
THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATION OF A NEW NATION
For most of us within Biafra our new nation was a dream that had become reality
—a republic, in the strict definition of the word: “a state in which the supreme
power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by
representatives chosen directly or indirectly by them.”1 We could forge a new
nation that respected the freedoms that all of mankind cherished and were
willing to fight hard to hold on to. Within Biafra the Biafran people would be
free of persecution of all kinds.
It did not escape Biafra’s founders that a great nation needed to be built on a
strong intellectual foundation. Our modest attempt to put the beginnings of our
thinking down on paper resulted in what would be known as the Ahiara
Declaration.2
In the Harmattan Season of 1968, Ojukwu invited me to serve on a small
political committee that the Ministry of Information was creating. The Ministry
of Information was the only place that an author would be comfortable, he told
me, because that was the venue of intellectual debate—where philosophy,
cultural matters, literature, politics, and society with all its elements were
discussed. The ministry had to play an important role in the new nation, he
insisted, as Biafra tried to free itself from the faults it saw in Nigeria.
So I joined this group and set to work. The questions that we raised within
the committee and later presented for broader discussion included: How would
we win this war and begin the creation of a new nation with the qualities we
seek? What did we want Biafra to look like? What would be the core
components of our new nation-state? What did we mean by citizenship and
nationhood? What would be Biafra’s relationship to other African countries?
What kind of education would the general population need to aid Biafra’s
development? How would Biafra attain these lofty goals?
The Biafran leader was pleased with the committee’s work and invited me to
serve as the chairman of a larger committee that he wanted to set up within the

state house. He called this new group the National Guidance Committee, and our
business would be to write a kind of constitution for Biafra—a promulgation of
the fundamental principles upon which the government and people of Biafra
would operate. The final work would be a living document that could be
modified over time and include at its core a set of philosophical rules that would
serve as a guide for the people of Biafra. The Biafran nation, Ojukwu explained,
had to have special attributes—the very principles that we approved of and were
fighting for: unity, self-determination, social justice, etc. The final version of the
document, we hoped, would also tell our story to the world—how Biafra had
been pushed out of Nigeria by Nigerians and threatened with genocide. The only
thing left for persecuted Easterners to do, we would stress, was to establish our
own state and avert destruction. That, essentially, was the basis of the
establishment of the Biafran nation.
Ojukwu then told me that he wanted the new committee to report directly to
him, outside the control of the cabinet. I became immediately apprehensive. I
was concerned that this arrangement could very easily become an area of
conflict between the cabinet and this new committee that I was going to head.
Who would be reporting to whom? And it seemed to me that Ojukwu wanted a
hold on the organs of government—these two organs, plus the military—not so
much separated but working at a pace and manner of his design. Nevertheless, I
went ahead and chose a much larger committee of experts for the task at hand. I
asked Ojukwu who he had in mind to be members of this larger committee.
Several names were thrown about. Finally we arrived at quite an impressive
group: Chieka Ifemesia, Ikenna Nzimiro, Justice A. N. Aniagolu, Dr. Ifegwu
Eke, and Eyo Bassey Ndem.3 But the group still lacked a scribe and secretary.
There was a healthy competition for the position between Professor Ben
Obumselu, who was an Oxford graduate like Ojukwu, and Professor Emmanuel
Obiechina, who held a PhD from Cambridge University. I remember telling
Ojukwu that Obiechina was educated in Cambridge, and he said, in the tradition
of classic Oxbridge rivalry, “Oh, he is from the other place,” and we all laughed.
In the end, Emmanuel Obiechina was appointed scribe and secretary.

—
The work of the National Guidance Committee eventually produced the treatise
widely known as the Ahiara Declaration. It was called “Ahiara” because
Ojukwu’s headquarters at this time was a camouflaged colonial building in the

village of Ahiara. Ojukwu was in hiding at that point of the hostilities. The
retreats he had before, in Umuahia and Owerri, which became famously referred
to as “Ojukwu bunkers,” were no longer available to him, having been bombed
by the Nigerian army.
The concept of the Ahiara Declaration was taken from a similar one issued
by President Julius Nyerere in Tanzania, called the Arusha Declaration. The
importance of Julius Nyerere in Africa at that time was immense. Nyerere
particularly caught the attention of African scholars because he stood for the
things we believed in—equality, self-determination, respect for human values. I
particularly liked how he drew inspiration from traditional African values and
philosophy. He was admired by all of us not just because of his reputation as an
incorruptible visionary leader endowed with admirable ideological positions, but
also because he had shown great solidarity for our cause. He was, after all, the
first African head of state to recognize Biafra.
Though we shared an admiration for President Nyerere and the Arusha
Declaration, members of the National Guidance Committee came to work with
diverse political beliefs, backgrounds, and influences; we did not all come from
the same ideological or political school of thought. There were those on the
committee who admired the American, British, and French notions of
democracy. There were those who harbored socialist, even communist, views,
who were influenced by the writings of Marcus Garvey, Karl Marx, Vladimir
Lenin, Fidel Castro, and the Argentine physician and Marxist revolutionary
Ernesto Che Guevera. Others liked local intellectuals such as the centrist
socialist Julius Nyerere, Patrice Lumumba, and Kwame Nkrumah. And still
others like me preferred democratic institutions not in the purely Western sense
but in a fusion of the good ideas of the West with the best that we had produced
in our own ancient African civilizations.
In my case, I drew heavily on my background in literature, history, and
theology. I also tapped into what I call “the observation of my reality”—an
extension of the things taught in the formal education of secondary school and
university into the education from life I picked up from our tradition. One
influential group were the orators, a group that fascinated me because they
always seemed to be able to find the right things to say to stop a crisis! I looked
out for people like that, who embodied a wholesome African wisdom—African
common sense; they were within our communities, and within the group that
would be called “the uneducated.” But they were arbiters of the traditional
values that had sustained our societies from the beginning of time.

One man, an Ozo title holder whose eloquence I always remembered,
personified what I thought was the essence of what we were trying to write and
should try to communicate. I remember distinctly watching as Okudo Onenyi,
with his fellow Ozo title holders, dressed in their impressive traditional regalia,
red caps and feathers, assembled for one of their Ozo meetings. One of the
things that struck me was the dignity of these old men, who arrived at the site of
the gathering carrying their little chairs that they would sit on.
At one particular meeting Okudo Onenyi was given a piece of chalk to mark
his insignia on the mud floor or wall, as these men were wont to do. What
surprised me was that Okudo took the piece of chalk and put down his initials. I
did not realize that this man had gone to school, but he obviously had. My
admiration for him rose, because he was one of those who was not easily
persuaded to abandon his ancient traditions, like the rest, to join a new culture or
religion, but he was willing to make a type of accommodation to his world’s new
dispensation. This man represented those who were still holding fort and not
putting up a physical fight. So it was not enough in my view to state that we
wanted to be radical and create a left-wing manifesto, but we also certainly did
not want to be right wing. It was that ancient traditional virtue I wanted to
channel into the Ahiara Declaration.
It took us several weeks to get the work we had done into one document. We
worked day and night. Chieka Ifemesia, Emmanuel Obiechina, and I did the
editing after the committee had spent days brooding over our situation and
prospects. Chieka Ifemesia, an emeritus professor at the University of Nigeria,
Nsukka, and a leading authority on Igbo history, would come to the table with
much more than his own memories or abstract intellectual concepts, but with a
great deal of relevant historical background and context. He was a solid historian
—serious, studious. He came from my own village of Ikenga in Ogidi. At the
time of the war he was regarded as a rising intellectual star and a person who
many of us relied upon for intellectual and cultural stimulation and ideas.
Emmanuel Obiechina pulled all the ideas together and transcribed the
committee’s work. My role was to keep some kind of control over the radical
elements in the group who had more extreme left-wing thinking, for instance, the
popular firebrand professor Ikenna Nzimiro.4
Nzimiro always had trouble with the establishment from his Nnamdi
Azikiwe youth wing “Zikist days.” He did not like the direction Nigeria was
going in, and he had no trouble expressing his dissenting views. He was perhaps
the youngest representative on the local government council in those days, and

he was very well-known everywhere for his radical positions. He was educated
in Germany and England, and his escapades were legendary. His stories kept us
all laughing for weeks.
Nzimiro disappeared in the middle of our writing the Ahiara Declaration, and
we were all very concerned. One day we were informed that the police had
locked him up. Apparently he had gotten into an argument with a police officer
who did not care for his radical views. Insults were exchanged and Nzimiro was
subsequently arrested. Emmanuel Obiechina told me what was going on. So we
went to Ojukwu and informed him of what was happening to a member of our
committee. Ojukwu called the chief of police, and we went to the police station
to pick up our ultraradical colleague.
On June 1, 1969, very close to the end of the war, Ojukwu finally delivered
this major speech, the Ahiara Declaration. It was an attempt to capture the
meaning of the struggle for Biafran sovereignty. He provided a historical
overview of the events that had led to the secession from Nigeria and the
founding of the Republic of Biafra. The speech was as notable for its
concentration on a number of issues that Biafra stood for—such as the rights to
liberty, safety, excellence, and self-determination—as it was for the things the
republic was against: genocide, racism, imperialism, and ethnic hatred, which
were squarely condemned. The speech also decried the blockade of Biafra
imposed by the federal government of Nigeria that was creating an avoidable
humanitarian crisis, particularly among children, who were dying in the
hundreds daily, and attacked the support of Nigeria by the major world powers.
The day this declaration was published and read by Ojukwu was a day of
celebration in Biafra. My late brother Frank described the effect of this Ahiara
Declaration this way: “Odika si gbabia agbaba” (“It was as if we should be
dancing to what Ojukwu was saying”). People listened from wherever they were.
It sounded right to them: freedom, quality, self-determination, excellence.
Ojukwu read it beautifully that day. He had a gift for oratory.

The Biafran State
I would like to say something about the structure of the Biafran state. The
Republic of Biafra took its name from the Bight of Biafra, the vast expanse of
water covering the continental shelf into which the Niger River empties before
flowing into the Gulf of Biafra. After Biafra’s surrender that body of water was
renamed the Gulf of Guinea. The origins of the word “Biafra” are difficult to
trace, although historical records point to Portuguese writings from the sixteenth
century that it may have been derived from.
The republic’s capital was initially Enugu, a metropolis of over one hundred
thousand at the time. It was also known as the coal city, a reference to the nearby
Onyeama Coal Mines and other coal deposits that once served as the fuel that
drove a large part of the Nigerian economy. Enugu was also the old
administrative capital of the Eastern Region. A well-planned, sedate capital, it
had a pleasant climate and the advantages of all the amenities of an important
urban center without the pathologies of a large conurbation.
When Enugu fell to the Nigerian army on October 4, 1967, the
administrative capital of Biafra was moved to Umuahia. Following the capture
of Umuahia on April 22, 1969, Biafra’s capital was moved once again, to
Owerri, the last administrative seat before the end of the war in January 1970.1
The population of Biafra in June 1967 was just under fifteen million people,
and it was home to a large number of ethnic groups in addition to the Igbo, who
made up about 65 percent of the population. The other major groups were the
Efik, Ibibio, Ijaw, and Ikwerre. Others included the Andoni, Agbo, Degema,
Egbema, Eket, Ekoi, Ibeno, Ikom, Iyalla, Kana, Mbembe, Uyanga, and Yako.2
Biafra was divided initially into eleven administrative provinces with as
many administrators. Later that number was expanded to twenty.3
Once secession was declared it became clear that the war effort required a
great deal of military equipment—artillery, planes, boats, tanks, guns, grenades,
mines, bombs, etc. Biafra needed a means to access foreign exchange and a legal
tender for commerce. One of the first things the new government did was to
establish the Bank of Biafra.
The Bank of Biafra was located in Enugu until the city fell in October 1967,

and then it was moved several times to different locations all over Igbo land,
with the seat of government. The bank’s first governor was Dr. Sylvester Ugoh.4
The legal tender produced by the institution in January 1968 was designed by
Simon Okeke and other talented local artists.5 The first denominations were the
five shilling and one pound notes. About a year later, the ten, five, and one
pound as well as the ten and five shilling notes were issued. The currency was
widely accepted in Biafra, although it was unavailable in large quantities, which
quickly made it a prized possession. Despite its usefulness, it was not a
recognized legal tender beyond Biafra’s borders and could not be used for
foreign exchange. This dilemma produced a number of challenges for the
Biafran government, which, we were told, used private bank accounts of wealthy
Biafrans to perform transactions abroad.

THE BIAFRAN FLAG
The flag of the Republic of Biafra was based on the Pan-Africanist teachings of
Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African
Communities League (UNIA-ACL). Garvey was a towering and controversial
figure, a major Pan-Africanist thinker and civil rights pioneer at the beginning of
the twentieth century, and his philosophy, known as Garveyism, was widely
admired by many Africans. It was Garvey’s organization that first came up with
the tricolored morphology of the Pan-African flag, with three horizontal bands,
red, black, and green, to symbolize the common ancestry and political
aspirations of all black people around the world. Kenya, St. Kitts and Nevis, and
Malawi are just some of the many African and Caribbean nations that adopted
variations of this flag.
The red in Garvey’s conception highlighted the blood that links all people of
African ancestry, as well as blood shed during slavery and liberation struggles
around the globe. In the Biafran context it was used to represent blood shed
during the pogroms and the quest for independence.
The black was seen as the affirmation of “an African nation State” by the
UNIA-ACL. In Biafra, it was a symbolic ancestral connection to souls of years
past. The green in both Garvey’s and Biafra’s concepts stood for Africa’s
abundant natural wealth and resources, and its radiant future. The Biafran flag
also highlighted these aspirations with a rising golden sun and rays representing
the eleven original provinces in the republic.6

THE BIAFRAN NATIONAL ANTHEM
The Nigeria-Biafra War led to an explosion of musical, lyrical, and poetic
creativity and artistry. Biafra’s founders tapped into this energy and
commissioned a number of regimental drills, duty songs, and cadences7 that they
hoped would “spur armies to victory and excite the populace to political and
economic vitality.”8
The Biafran national anthem, “Land of the Rising Sun,” was based on a
powerful poem by Nigeria’s first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe, called “Onitsha
Ado N’Idu: Land of the Rising Sun.”9 Laced with irony, the poem contained
several phrases that would become all too prophetic: “But if the price is death for
all we hold dear, / Then let us die without a shred of fear. . . . / Spilling our blood
we’ll count a privilege; . . . / We shall remember those who died in mass; . . .”10
The anthem was set to the beautiful music of the Finnish composer Jean
Sibelius11—Finlandia (Be Still My Soul)—a personal favorite of, and calculated
choice by, Ojukwu, “in reference to the Nordic country’s resistance to foreign
domination.”12
Later, after Azikiwe withdrew his support for the breakaway republic, we
would learn that there was some controversy over the adaptation of Azikiwe’s
poetry. According to Zik, Ojukwu had used his work without permission, a
charge the Biafran head of state vigorously denied.13

The Biafra National Anthem
LAND OF THE RISING SUN14

Land of the rising sun, we love and cherish, beloved homeland of our brave
heroes; we must defend our lives or we shall perish,
We shall protect our hearth from all our foes; but if the price is death for all
we hold dear,
Then let us die without a shred of fear.
Hail to Biafra, consecrated nation,
Oh fatherland, this is our solemn pledge: Defending thee shall be a
dedication, spilling our blood we’ll count a privilege;
The waving standard which emboldens the free shall always be our flag of
liberty.

We shall emerge triumphant from this ordeal, and through the crucible
unscathed we’ll pass;
When we are poised the wounds of battle to heal, we shall remember those
who died in mass;
Then shall our trumpets peal the glorious song of victory we scored o’er
might and wrong.
Oh God, protect us from the hidden pitfall, Guide all our movements lest we
go astray; Give us the strength to heed the humanist call:
“To give and not to count the cost” each day; Bless those who rule to serve
with resoluteness, to make this clime a land of righteousness.15

THE MILITARY
Biafra had only two thousand troops at the beginning of the war. Most of the
soldiers were former Nigerian army soldiers—Easterners who were based in
Enugu and other former Nigerian military bases in the east. General Philip
Effiong, Biafra’s chief of general staff, quickly recruited an additional twenty
thousand men and created a separate Biafran militia of civilian volunteers, who
received on-the-spot training. The Biafrans were devoid of any heavy military
equipment apart from that of the former Nigerian battalion stationed in Enugu,
Saracen armored cars, and 105 millimeter howitzers.16 Federick Forsyth recalls
in an excellent BBC documentary, Biafra: Fighting a War Without Guns, that
Biafran soldiers marched into war one man behind the other because they had
only one rifle between them, and the thinking was that if one soldier was killed
in combat the other would pick up the only weapon available and continue
fighting.17
The Biafrans were completely outgunned compared to the Nigerians. The
Soviet Union and Britain not only supplied Nigeria with brand-new MIG-17 and
II-28 Beagle (Ilyushin) jets but also with Soviet T-34 battle tanks, antiaircraft
guns, AK-47 rifles, machine guns, grenades, mines, bombs, etc.18
In light of this imbalance of resources, international support for Biafra was
crucial. Arguably the most notable of all the Europeans that came to the aid of
Biafra was Carl Gustaf von Rosen. He was a Swedish nobleman and World War
II veteran. Von Rosen became a legend in the 1930s when he volunteered to fly
Red Cross relief supplies into Ethiopia and fight for Emperor Haile Selassie

against the Italians.19 He again came into the world’s consciousness as the pilot
of the much admired United Nations secretary general Dag Hammarskjöld, who
was widely regarded as a “dove of peace.” Hammarskjöld “mysteriously” died in
an air crash while serving as the chief mediator of the Congo crisis of the 1960s,
unfortunately at a time when his much trusted pilot, von Rosen, was ill.
It was von Rosen’s Biafran involvement, however, that truly catapulted him
to worldwide recognition. Von Rosen was outraged by the injustice of the war
and Nigeria’s imposition of an economic blockade on the Republic of Biafra,
and he was moved to come to the aid of the suffering. It was in part because of
this brave man’s involvement that the world was motivated to pay attention to
this conflict in a heretofore forgotten part of the world. Von Rosen bore witness
to the atrocities and humanitarian emergency in Biafra, and his public statements
and influence propelled a number of Western relief agencies to respond to the
crisis.20
He led multiple relief flights with humanitarian aid into Uli airport—Biafra’s
chief airstrip. Fed up with Nigerian air force interference with his peaceful
missions, he entered the war heroes hall of fame after leading a five-plane
assault on Nigerian aircraft in Port Harcourt, Benin City, Ughelli, Enugu, and
some other locations. He took the Nigerian air force by total surprise and
destroyed several Soviet-supplied aircraft in the process.21
The Biafran air force was composed of a B-26, a B-25, and three
helicopters22 until Carl Gustaf von Rosen23 came to the republic’s assistance in
1968. By year’s end the government of Biafra had procured a moderate amount
of military ammunition from the neighboring former French colonies of Ivory
Coast and Gabon.
Indeed, Paris’s ambassador to Gabon at the time of war, Maurice Delauney,
worked with Jacques Foccart’s deputy, Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré—described by
French journalist Pierre Péan as the “chief conductor of clandestine French
support to the Biafran secessionists”—to supply arms to Ojukwu’s army.24
Uli airport was the major airport in Biafra for military and relief goods at the
height of the war, and it was described by various authorities as one of the
busiest airports in Africa, with more than 50 flights a night.25
Uli airport, originally part of a major highway, had been cut into the
countryside in the middle of a tropical rainforest and operated mainly at night. I
recall the airport’s traffic control terminal, passenger facilities, and hangars were
constructed in such a manner that the entire runway and all of the planes on the
ground could be heavily camouflaged with palm leaves and raffia fronds during

the day, disguising it from Nigerian army aircraft reconnaissance missions and
radar.26 At night the airport became a beehive of activity. Incoming flights
carrying relief supplies, particularly from international locations such as São
Tomé, Abidjan in Ivory Coast, and Libreville, Gabon, were given the airport’s
coordinates after appropriate background checks were done. Pilots who were
involved in the airlifts of relief supplies provided a compelling story:
In the middle of the vast expanse of tropical rainforest, we would be told to descend
from our cruising altitude to about two thousand feet to avoid enemy fire, barely atop
the forest in the pitch dark. All of a sudden, bright floodlights appeared from nowhere,
illuminating the forest floor. Right before us was a breathtaking sight—an entire
airport appearing from nowhere!27

OGBUNIGWE
The economic blockade enforced by Gowon led to great ingenuity and some
unprecedented innovations. Biafran scientists from the research think tank RAP
—the Biafran Research and Production unit—developed a great number of
rockets, bombs, and telecommunications gadgets, and devised an ingenious
indigenous strategy to refine petroleum.28
Still, some of these innovations deserve particular attention, though in doing
so I would like to make it crystal clear that I abhor violence, and a discussion of
weapons of war does not imply that I am a war enthusiast or condone violence.
Perhaps no more important instrument of war lay at the disposal of the
Biafrans than the bomb called “Ogbunigwe.” Gordian Ezekwe, Benjamin
Chukwuka Nwosu, and the less well-known technician Willy Achukwe were
among the group of originators of this notorious weapon. Ogbunigwe would
later become widely adopted and manufactured by the RAP engineers. The bomb
was a complex three-chamber apparatus that often included delayed action
devices containing a propellant, an explosive substance—often gunpowder in an
igniting base—and scraps of metal for maximal effect. Ogbunigwe bombs struck
great terror in the hearts of many a Nigerian soldier, and were used to great
effect by the Biafran army throughout the conflict.29 The novelist Vincent
Chukwuemeka Ike captures the hysteria and dread evoked by it in a passage in
his important book Sunset at Dawn: A Novel about Biafra:
When the history of this war comes to be written, the ogbunigwe [sic] and the shore
batteries will receive special mention as Biafra’s greatest saviors. We’ve been able to
wipe out more Nigerians with those devices than with any imported weapons. . . .

You must have heard that the Nigerians are now so mortally afraid of ogbunigwe
[sic] that each advancing battalion is now preceded by a herd of cattle.30

BIAFRAN TANKS
The first Biafran “tanks” turned out to be steel-reinforced Range Rovers. By
their third incarnation these armored fighting vehicles, or AFVs, had become
quite sophisticated, with rocket launchers added.
Let me give one more dimension of what we were hoping to do in Biafra,
and what this freedom and independence was supposed to be like. We were told,
for instance, that technologically we would have to rely for a long, long time on
the British and the West for everything. European oil companies insisted that oilindustry technology was so complex that we would never ever in the next five
hundred years be able to figure it out. We knew that wasn’t true. In fact, we
learned to refine our own oil during the two and a half years of the struggle,
because we were blockaded. We were able to demonstrate that it was possible
for African people, entirely on their own, to refine oil.31
We were able to show that Africans could pilot their own planes. There is a
story, perhaps apocryphal, that a Biafran plane landed in another African
country, and the pilot and all of the crew came out, and there was not a white
man among them. The people of this other country—which is a stooge of France
—couldn’t comprehend a plane being landed without any white people. They
said, “Where is the pilot? Where are the white people?” They arrested the crew,
presuming there had been a rebellion in the air!
There was enough talent, enough education in Nigeria for us to have been
able to arrange our affairs more efficiently, more meticulously, even if not
completely independently, than we were doing.32 I tell these stories to illustrate
the quality of the people available to Nigeria. One thinks back on this and is
amazed. Nigeria had people of great quality, and what befell us—the corruption,
the political ineptitude, the war—was a great disappointment and truly
devastating to those of us who witnessed it.33

A TIGER JOINS THE ARMY
A great shot in the arm, and perhaps the single most effective tool for enlistment
into the Biafran army, came in January 1968, when Richard Ihetu, also known as

Dick Tiger, hung up his boxing gloves and enlisted in the army. Ihetu was a
world-renowned boxer from Amaigbo in Imo state—“the land of the Igbos”—a
town comprised of thirty-seven villages and steeped in ancient Igbo history.34
Ojukwu made Dick Tiger a lieutenant in the army of Biafra as soon as he
enlisted.35
Even though I was never a boxing fan, I remember how the whole of Nigeria
was gripped by a feverish excitement at Dick Tiger’s victories, first locally, as
Nigeria’s most celebrated boxing champion, then also later, after he emigrated to
the United Kingdom and knocked over famous boxers across the British Empire,
and ultimately won world championships both as a light-heavyweight and as a
middleweight. We were all very impressed that this young man from a town near
Aba in Imo state had traveled so far.36 Dick Tiger’s decision to enlist, and to
return the MBE (Member of the British Empire) medal to Great Britain’s
government in protest of its support for Nigeria, caused a great stir
internationally.37
Excitement at the news of Dick Tiger’s arrival created a rippling sensation
throughout Biafra. The government seized on this development and created
jingles on the radio summoning young men to “follow the example of Dick Tiger
and join the great Elephant (Enyi) of a new nation.” But the realities of war—the
death, the despair, the suffering—soon dampened any euphoria that we all had
about having a champion fight for the cause.

FREEDOM FIGHTERS
Ojukwu created an organization called the Biafran Organization of Freedom
Fighters (BOFF) as a unit that would improve the overall relationship between
the Biafran army and the people it served and on whose behalf it fought. Colonel
Ejike Obumneme Aghanya was appointed the chairperson. He had been
president of the Nigerian Broadcasting Service Staff Union in Enugu when I was
the controller of the Nigerian Broadcasting Service Eastern Region. Aghanya’s
BOFF staff included Dr. Ukwu I. Ukwu, Dr. Oyolu, and Major Okoye. Aghanya
invited me to join the group and help develop an education strategy that would
improve civilian-military relations.
Although this desire to bridge the civilian-military divide is nothing new,
Ojukwu wanted the Biafran military to be different, to pay careful attention to
the welfare of the people of Biafra. One interesting direction they took was to

get young women into BOFF, and indirectly into the army.38
Ojukwu’s Oxford education afforded him the luxury of having been exposed
to both the great world philosophers and the revolutionaries of the day. He was
heavily influenced by the writings of Fidel Castro, and he called the Biafran
army the People’s Army of Biafra. He also admired the way the Chinese army
was structured, and it is relevant to note that BOFF arose at a time when China
was making diplomatic inroads in Biafra. Ojukwu clearly was not a communist,
but he borrowed some ideas from their revolutions.39
After I left the BOFF outfit I heard that it was engaged in the more
militaristic and controversial aspects of war, such as enemy infiltration, guerrilla
warfare, and propaganda.40

Traveling on Behalf of Biafra
In addition to working with BOFF, Ojukwu also asked me to serve the cause as
an unofficial envoy of the people of Biafra. Being invited to serve by the leader
of Biafra was both an important and satisfying opportunity, but it also came with
great anxiety. What were we getting into? I thought. I never solicited the post, so
being asked from the very top to come and help, especially from the angle of the
intellectual, was very important to me. I wasn’t absolutely sure how things
would work out, but I thought I would do my best.
The first trip I undertook on behalf of the people of Biafra was at the direct
request of General Ojukwu. He called me to his office soon after the conflict
started and asked me to travel to Senegal to deliver a message to President
Léopold Sédar Senghor. I was to be accompanied on this trip by a young
academic, Sam Agbam, who spoke several European languages fluently. He was
among the young intellectuals in the Biafran diplomatic service involved in one
way or another in the framing of the “Biafran argument.��
Sam and I set out for Senegal. During these “trips for the people” envoys
were often put on a plane—a private plane . . . any plane, at midnight, from Uli
airport, flying out of Biafra across the Sahara, occasionally to Europe or an
African capital, from whence we would travel more freely to the destinations of
our choice.
During this particular flight the pilot announced at about twenty thousand
feet that the plane was experiencing “technical problems.” It was marked by a
great deal of turbulence and sudden losses of cabin pressure. We were all
experiencing motion sickness, some were vomiting, and all were stricken by a
sense of impending doom. The plane was diverted to an airport in the Sahara,
where we disembarked, changed to a Senegalese airline, and flew to Dakar.
Sam Agbam “vanished” at some point during our travel; I was never told
why he did not continue the journey. Soon thereafter he got in trouble with the
Biafran government—accused of being part of a mutiny—and was executed with
others for allegedly plotting a coup against Ojukwu, as discussed earlier.
After we lost each other I decided to take control of the journey, despite the
language barrier. I arrived in the beautiful capital of the Republic of Senegal,

Dakar, and checked myself into one of the city’s many smart hotels.
I visited the presidential offices the day after my arrival and tried to get the
letter from General Ojukwu in my possession to President Senghor. I couldn’t
get past the presidential aides. The officials there, all expatriate administrators,
responded to my request with looks of incredulity. They could not even imagine
anything like opening the door and showing me in to see the Senegalese
president. They must have thought I was crazy!
There was one very tall man who spoke very good English, and he said to me
that there was no way I could see the president.
“What do you want to see him for?” he asked.
I said that I would like to present my new novel, A Man of the People, to
him. I also added that I knew that President Senghor was a great writer and poet,
and I thought I should show my appreciation of his writing by presenting my
humble effort at writing poetry. Clearly that was not what I wanted to do, but I
was not about to disclose my true intentions to this uncooperative gentleman.
“Oh, that is easy enough: You give me the book and poems and I will take it
to him, and I am sure he will be delighted,” the official said.
I said that I would like to deliver it myself, that that was the reason I had
come all this way. There was nothing more the official could tell me, and I was
sent away.
The next day, and the next, I went back and repeated the process in an
attempt to see Senghor. Either my tenacity was working or the staff was getting
tired of seeing me every morning, because I got a new message five days into
this ritual: “President Léopold Sédar Senghor will see you tomorrow.” This
message was brought in a black limousine. A member of the hotel staff ran up to
my room, knocked on the door, and excitedly relayed that I had a message from
the presidential palace. The esteem in which I was held in the eyes of the people
and staff in the hotel, you can imagine, rose dramatically. After that my stay was
very different. Soon after my arrival I had complained to the hotel front desk that
the fan in my room was not working well, but nothing was done about it until the
limousine visit from the presidential palace, soon after which I was informed
that the fan had been attended to.
The next day I had my audience with President Léopold Sédar Senghor, a
very extraordinary man. I was guided along a stone path in the gardens of the
presidential palace and up the grand staircase to a secluded room. The first thing
that struck me was the loneliness. We were standing in a room in this huge
mansion, I in my Biafran attire, Senghor in his French suit, and he seemed all

alone. He knew that I came from Biafra, in West Africa. I handed Senghor the
letter that informed him of the real catastrophe building up in Biafra, and I told
him that it was a message from the Biafran head of state, who had asked me to
deliver the sealed envelope directly to him. Senghor regretted that I had spent
several days in the country trying to reach him and apologized for the treatment I
had received. Senghor was a profoundly adept diplomat, and he took on the
business I brought: He glanced through the letter quickly, and then turned to me
and said that he would deal with it overnight . . . as soon as possible.
Our conversation then turned to other things intellectual—writing, education,
the great cultural issues of the day, including the movement he was spearheading
called Négritude. La Négritude, as it was called, was already widely known in
serious intellectual circles around the world: “The founders of la Négritude, les
trois pères (the three fathers) [Léopold Sédar Senghor; Aimé Césaire, from
Martinique; and Léon Gontran Damas, from Guyana] met while they were living
in Paris in the early 1930s.”1

—
It is important not to view Négritude in isolation but in the full context of the
black consciousness movements of the first half of the twentieth century, a
period that gave rise to a number of ideological and intellectual movements in
America, the Caribbean, and Africa and a great deal of cross-fertilization and
complexity.
Négritude in Africa can be seen as an extension of the earlier work of W. E.
B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, Marcus Garvey, and C. L. R. James, among
others; they all established black intellectual and political liberation struggles but
from very different albeit equally important vantage points in America. In the
African context it was a reaction to the colonial experience through literature and
political thought. It had powerful political allies in Nnamdi Azikiwe in Nigeria,
Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Julius Nyerere in
Tanzania, Patrice Lumumba in Congo, and, later, Nelson Mandela, Steve Biko,
and Walter Sisulu in South Africa. It is pertinent to note that the independence
movement in Africa in turn had a profound impact on the civil rights movement
in America.
I found what these intellectuals were trying to achieve—the reclamation of
the power of self-definition to recast Africa’s, and therefore their own, image
through the written word—incredibly attractive and influential. Here were highly

sophisticated individuals who believed in the need for blacks who had been
victims of historical dispossession to appreciate and elevate their culture—
literature, art, music, dance, etc. They encouraged Africans (in the word’s
broadest definition) to celebrate and espouse their culture as not only not inferior
to European culture and civilization but equally acceptable even if
fundamentally different.
Négritude also held that the rest of the world would benefit from such an
intellectual black renaissance, which would at last produce an environment
where race, a core fact of our existence, and the negative baggage linked to its
definition and meaning, would be effectively deemphasized, liberating the
world’s people to work together unencumbered. It was very heavy stuff indeed!2
It is perhaps a great testament to the importance of this new thinking that it drew
admirers as diverse and important as Frantz Fanon (who studied with Aimé
Césaire), the great French writer Jean-Paul Sartre, and the Haitian writer Jacques
Romain, as well as critics such as Wole Soyinka, who famously dismissed it.3
Senghor told me about the education minister who had been trained under
him and had submitted a bill to Parliament to abolish the use of all French texts
in all institutions of education in Senegal. Senghor smiled and told the young
minister, “Thank you for your bill, but that would be too much Négritude.” We
both laughed, and then talked for about two hours—discussing his poetry and
that of others from the black diaspora—Okigbo, Derek Walcott, Aimé Césaire,
Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, etc. He took me to one of the great windows
of the presidential palace and showed me two hills; he observed that the
mountaintops looked like “a lady lying down.”

—
I also made an extensive trip to Scandinavia on behalf of the people of Biafra
around this time. The Scandinavians had made great humanitarian gestures to
alleviate the suffering in Biafra. I was also curious to visit the land of one of the
most legendary of all the Europeans who came to our aid—the Swedish
aristocrat Carl Gustaf von Rosen. On this trip I visited Sweden, Finland, and
Norway.
I remember Norway vividly. Even though I visited during the winter, it
appeared a lovely country– subdued, calm, and temperate. The people seemed
very serious-minded, and businesslike, and very progressive in their thinking.
My hosts took me almost immediately after I arrived to the Parliament. What

struck me about this particular day was the importance the Norwegians place on
time, even more than I had encountered in England. Here was a people that knew
that time was critically important, and it was to be used judiciously. Another
observation of significance had to do with the items on the program. It appeared
to be like a service—a hymn or anthem was sung, followed by deliberations and
readings—all in Norwegian, so I can’t tell the reader exactly what was being
said, but it sounded almost like a religious service. When they were done, I was
ushered into this wonderfully built, ornate Parliament room, and a gentleman
said to me: “Now Mr. Achebe, you can tell us what you came for.” And I spent
about twenty minutes telling my hosts about the humanitarian disaster that was
Biafra. I received a warm round of applause and promises of continued
humanitarian support.
The other thing that happened during my trip to Norway was, unfortunately
for millions around the world, very sad. As I walked back to my hotel with my
hosts, I was able to tell from the conspicuous news flashing on a huge screen that
Robert Kennedy had been assassinated. I was able to figure out the devastating
news from the flashing words, even without help from my hosts, and it struck me
how bad news is so much more easily recognizable across languages than good.
My trip to Canada was very different from the others. I was invited to speak
about the Biafran tragedy by the World Council of Churches and the Canadian
Council of Churches. The World Council of Churches was one of the most
magnanimous supporters and suppliers of humanitarian relief for the suffering
and dying of Biafra, so I felt deeply obliged to attend their gathering. The
general secretary of the WCC, Eugene Carson Blake, and the honorary president
of the WCC, Willem Visser ’t Hooft from The Netherlands, were very decent
men. Blake, an American, was an ardent supporter of the American civil rights
movement and a coauthor of the WCC’s antiracism policies. Hooft helped set up
the Ecumenical Church Loan Fund for the poor around the world.4
It is important to point out that the Protestants did not hold a monopoly on
generosity during the war. Several Jewish groups and Roman Catholic orders
also came to the aid of the destitute.
Reverend Father (Dr.) Georg Hüssler, former president of Caritas
International, is particularly celebrated till this day by former Biafrans for his
towering role in providing humanitarian and other aid during the conflict.
In any case, our hosts, the Canadian Council of Churches, organized a dinner
in my honor and invited a number of very distinguished Canadians and religious
leaders from around the world. When they brought out the first course—smoked

salmon with steamed spinach—Eugene Carson Blake announced to the guests
that we were about to eat a piece of Uli airport at night, which, many of them at
the table were aware, was famously and effectively camouflaged with palm
fronds and leaves to hide it from Nigerian air force reconnaissance missions.
That statement was greeted with boisterous laughter. It occured to me once again
how different Biafra had become from other places, where laughter was still
available.
In May 1968, I was part of the Biafran delegation that attended the Kampala,
Uganda, talks—one of the world’s failed attempts (in this case, the British
Commonwealth and the OAU) to forge a peace between Nigeria and Biafra.
President Milton Obote of Uganda hosted the deliberations that also involved
Commonwealth secretary Arnold Smith.5 Sir Louis Mbanefo was the leader of
that delegation, which also included Professor Hilary Okam, Francis Ellah, and a
few others. It was at that meeting that I met Aminu Kano for the first time. As
the Nigerian delegation, led by Anthony Enahoro, espoused their resolve to
“crush Biafra” unless there was a complete surrender, Aminu Kano seemed very
uneasy, often looking through the window. This was a man who was not pleased
with either side or how the matter was being handled. That meeting made an
indelible mark on me about Aminu Kano, about his character and his intellect.
In late 1968, I traveled to the United States with Gabriel Okara and Cyprian
Ekwensi as part of an extensive university tour to bring the story of Biafra to the
mainly progressive American intellectuals and writers. We visited scores of
campuses, gave what seemed to be hundreds of interviews, and met with several
very influential American leaders of thought.
During my visit we were educated about Igbo (Ebo) landing in St. Simons,
Georgia. According to the local lore, “Ebo Landing” was the site where an illfated slave ship called The Wanderer had run aground. The valuable cargo—the
captured Igbos—were taken onshore while the crew rescued what they could
from the bowels of the ship. While the crew was distracted, the story continues,
the Igbos made a suicide pact, deciding to walk into the ocean and drown
themselves rather than allow the slave merchants to sell them into bondage.
Locals swear that the shores of the tragedy are still haunted, and that on a clear
moon-lit night a visitor who stands really still can hear the howls and agony of
death.6

REFUGEE MOTHER AND CHILD (A MOTHER IN A
REFUGEE CAMP)
No Madonna and Child could touch
Her tenderness for a son
She soon would have to forget. . . .
The air was heavy with odors of diarrhea,
Of unwashed children with washed-out ribs
And dried-up bottoms waddling in labored steps
Behind blown-empty bellies. Most mothers there
Had long ceased to care, but not this one;
She held a ghost-smile between her teeth,
And in her eyes the memory
Of a mother’s pride. . . . She had bathed him
And rubbed him down with bare palms.
She took from the bundle of their possessions
A broken comb and combed
The rust-colored hair left on his skull
And then—humming in her eyes—began carefully to part it.
In their former life this was perhaps
A little daily act of no consequence
Before his breakfast and school; now she did it
Like putting flowers on a tiny grave.1

Life in Biafra
The Nigeria-Biafra conflict created a humanitarian emergency of epic
proportions. Millions of civilians—grandparents, mothers, fathers, children, and
soldiers alike—flooded the main highway arteries between towns and villages
fleeing the chaos and conflict. They traveled by foot, by truck, by car, barefoot,
with slippers, in wheelbarrows, many in worn-out shoes. Some had walked so
long their soles were blistered and bleeding. As hunger and thirst grew, so did
despair, confusion, and desperation. Most were heading in whatever direction the
other was headed, propelled by the latest rumors of food and shelter spreading
through the multitude like a virus. Refugees were on the move in no specific
direction, anywhere, just away from the fighting. As they fled the war zones they
became targets of the Nigerian air force. The refugees learned to travel nights
and hide in the forests by day.
The international relief agencies started responding to the growing
humanitarian challenge quite early in the conflict by establishing food
distribution centers and refugee camps. There were many Biafran refugee camps
dotting the landscape, from Enugu in the north to Owerri in the south, during the
thirty-month conflict. Many held between a few hundred and a few thousand
people. At the height of the war there were well over three thousand such centers
and camps, a great number but woefully inadequate to the actual need.1
These camps were often hastily constructed tent villages set up beside
bombed-out churches, in football or sports arenas, or in open fields in the forest.
They uniformly lacked electricity, running water, or other comforts.
Occasionally, the more established camps had sturdier shelters on the premises
of abandoned schools or colleges, or built near freshwater streams or little rivers.
Those were few and far between. Most had rows of mud huts and palm raffia
roofs built hastily by the inhabitants themselves. They were occasionally fenced
in by the international agencies, which placed guards on the camp perimeter to
monitor movement in and out of the area. The relief agencies often hoisted their
flags to indicate to the Nigerian officers that they were in neutral zones that
should be protected from assault. That did not always keep the Nigerian troops
from raiding these “safe havens,” or even from bombing them.

Life in the camps varied in quality. Some of the better organized camps
provided water, shelter, food, basic health care—mainly vaccinations for
children against the most prevalent diseases, and treatment of common bacterial
infections—and education. Other camps could only be described as deplorable,
epidemic-ridden graveyards. In these camps the combination of poor sanitation,
high population density, and shortages of supplies created a bitter cocktail of
despair, giving rise to social pathologies and psychological traumas of all kinds
—violence, extortion, and physical and sexual abuse.

—
My siblings and their families returned to my father’s house in Ogidi from
various parts of the country. My family did too: Christie and my children at the
time, Chinelo and Ike, left Port Harcourt for my family’s ancestral home.
My village is about six miles from Onitsha, the commercial hub of Eastern
Nigeria and the location of the largest market in West Africa. Onitsha is also
where the famous Niger Bridge is located, and so it serves as the entry point for
all travelers entering the East from points west. The close proximity of Ogidi to
Onitsha meant that we were in the eye of the storm, as it were, right at the border
of the conflict. We were so close to the war zone we could hear the sounds of
war—heavy artillery fire, bombs, and machine-gun fights.2
By the time I left Lagos to join my family in Ogidi, there were rumors that
the Nigerian army was not that far behind. Casting my mind back, I am surprised
at how little pandemonium there was during the early stages of the conflict.
Families casually began to move deeper into the countryside to prepare for the
inevitability of war.
Food was short, meat was very short, and drugs were short. Thousands—no,
millions by then—had been uprooted from their homes and brought into safer
areas, but where they really had no relatives, no property; many of them lived in
school buildings and camps. The Committee for Biafran Refugees,
understandably overwhelmed, did what it could. I found it really quite amazing
how much people were ready to give.
Beyond the understandable trepidation associated with a looming war, one
found a new spirit among the people, a spirit one did not know existed, a
determination, in fact. The spirit was that of a people ready to put in their best
and fight for their freedom. Biafran churches made links to the persecution of the
early Christians, others on radio to the Inquisition and the persecution of the

Jewish people. The prevalent mantra of the time was “Ojukwu nye anyi egbe ka
anyi nuo agha”—“Ojukwu give us guns to fight a war.” It was an energetic,
infectious duty song, one sung to a well-known melody and used effectively to
recruit young men into the People’s Army (the army of the Republic of Biafra).
But in the early stages of the war, when the Biafran army grew quite rapidly,
sadly Ojukwu had no guns to give to those brave souls.
But the most vital feeling Biafrans had at that time was that they were finally
in a safe place . . . at home. This was the first and most important thing, and one
could see this sense of exhilaration in the effort that the people were putting into
the war. Young girls, for example, had taken over the job of controlling traffic.
They were really doing it by themselves—no one asked them to. That this kind
of spirit existed made us feel tremendously hopeful. Clearly something had
happened to the psyche of an entire people to bring this about.
Richard West, a British journalist, was so captivated by the meticulous nature
with which Biafrans conducted the affairs of state that he wrote a widely cited
article in which he lamented: “Biafra is more than a human tragedy. Its defeat, I
believe, would mark the end of African independence. Biafra was the first place
I had been to in Africa where the Africans themselves were truly in charge.”3

—
Soon after I arrived in Ogidi we were told that Nigerian soldiers, led by Murtala
Muhammed, were trying to cross the Niger Bridge from Asaba into Onitsha, and
were being kept at bay by the Biafran colonel Achuzia (aka “Air Raid”
Achuzia). Shuwa’s troops were marching into Igbo land across the Benue River
in the north at the same time. There was quite an overwhelming sense of anxiety
in the air.
We had all gone to bed on one particular night—my family, Augustine and
his family, and Frank and his family. We did not realize that Biafran soldiers had
set up their armory outside my father’s house, on the veranda, the porch, and
outside in the yard. The house was in a choice location, atop a small hill, and
was clearly chosen by the army as a perfect site from which to shell the
advancing Nigerian army and to surprise them with sniper fire.
By this time in the war we—at least some of us—had gotten used to sleeping
with the sound of shelling and explosions, and occasional howls of pain and
what some villagers called “the stench of death.” Others would recount that they
did not sleep a wink through the war, an exaggeration of course, but a valid point

nonetheless; sleeplessness was endemic. On this particular night we were
oblivious to what was going on outside our father’s house. While we were
sleeping the Biafran army was turning our ancestral home into a military base of
sorts. No one asked us for permission. They did not knock to ask or to inform. In
hindsight, what happened next was enough to have caused sudden cardiac arrest
in some people. We all were awakened violently from sleep by a loud ka-boom!,
followed by the rattling of the house foundation and walls, indeed of the entire
house. A number of people who were asleep fell off their beds, violently ushered
back into reality by the vibrations, the shock, and the noise of the artillery fire
outside. It was awful.
The men in the house went outside to find out what was going on. A colonel
who was in charge of this exercise explained that they had decided to use our
home as a tactical base because it provided them a logistical and strategic
advantage as they shelled the encroaching federal troops. Surely it was time for
us to leave.

The Abagana Ambush
On March 25, 1968, the Second Division of the Nigerian army finally broke
through the Biafran resistance and entered Onitsha. (The federal troops had
failed the first attempt to cross the Niger, suffering great casualties at the hands
of Achuzia’s guerrilla army; this was the second attempt.) Their plan following
this development was to link up these federal troops with the forces of the First
Division, led by Colonel Shuwa, that were penetrating the Igbo heartland from
the north. The amalgamation of these two forces, the Nigerian army hoped,
would then serve as a formidable force that would “smash the Biafrans.”1
Colonel Murtala Muhammed hastily deployed a convoy of ninety-six vehicles
and four armored cars to facilitate this plan on March 31, 1968.
Biafran intelligence was swift to respond, and it informed Major Johnathan
Uchendu, who formulated an elaborate plan. He arranged a seven-hundred-manstrong counterattack that essentially sealed off the Abagana Road. He
commanded his troops to lie in ambush in the forest near Abagana, waiting
patiently for the advancing Nigerians and their reinforcements. Major Uchendu’s
strategy proved to be highly successful. His troops destroyed Muhammed’s
entire convoy within one and a half hours. All told the Nigerians suffered about
five hundred casualties. There was minimal loss of life on the Biafran side.
Very few federal soldiers survived this ambush, and those who did were
found walking dazed and aimless in the bush. There were widespread reports of
atrocities perpetrated by angry Igbo villagers who captured these wandering
soldiers. One particularly harrowing report claimed that a mob of villagers cut
their capture into pieces. I was an eyewitness to one such angry blood frenzy of
retaliation after a particularly tall and lanky soldier—clearly a mercenary from
Chad or Mali—wandered into an ambush of young men with machetes. His
lifeless body was found mutilated on the roadside in a matter of seconds. “Gifts”
of poisoned water–filled calabashes were left in strategic places throughout the
deserted villages to “welcome” the thirsty federal troops.
My elder sister’s family took refuge in Nnobi during all this commotion, the
town where I was born. My father had settled there as a catechist and a teacher
half a century earlier. The hosts of my sister and her family began to tell them

that it was from my father that the people of that village learned to eat rice about
fifty years before his children returned to this bucolic town as refugees. The
host, a man of great consideration and taste, proclaimed that he was, therefore,
going to cook rice for my sister’s family to salute my father. There were attempts
to humanize our existence despite the horrors that surrounded us all. Life went
on as much as the people could manage it.
Through it all, there was a great deal of humor. I remember one occasion
after an air raid—and these are really horrible things—somebody saw two
vultures flying very high up, and he said, “That is a fighter and a bomber,” and
everybody burst into laughter. It was a very poor joke, I know, but laughter
helped everyone there keep their sanity . . . that is, if you wanted to survive.
I did not realize how I was being affected by living under those
circumstances until I traveled out of Biafra on a mission to England. I heard
planes taking off and landing at Heathrow Airport, and my first instinct was to
duck under safe cover.2

AIR RAID
It comes so quickly
the bird of death
from evil forests of Soviet technology
A man crossing the road
to greet a friend
is much too slow.
His friend cut in halves

The Citadel Press
News filtered in that life approached some semblance of normalcy far away from
the immediate arenas of war. A few weeks after my arrival in Ogidi I was
informed that there was a job opening in Enugu, so I packed up my family at my
father’s house and headed farther east into Igbo land, and, we hoped, away from
the war zone.
Christopher Okigbo left his work at Cambridge University Press in Ibadan,
where he served as Cambridge’s West Africa manager. He suddenly appeared in
Enugu a few weeks after I arrived from Lagos. By the time we all arrived back
in Eastern Nigeria, after escaping the massacres across the rest of the country, it
became clear to me that it would be beneficial to the cause of Biafra if
intellectuals worked together to support the war effort. Christopher came to me
and requested that we establish a publishing house. It immediately seemed to me
to be a very good idea, for we believed it was necessary at this time to publish
books, especially children’s books, that would have relevance to our society.
This was something we felt very strongly about. We felt we wanted to
develop literature for children based on local thought, and we set up a firm
called The Citadel Press. Biafra declared its independence while we were
developing our plans, and we were more confident than ever that what we were
doing was good for the cause. Christopher proceeded to get a plot of land in a
key area of Enugu off one of the city’s major thoroughfares—today’s Michael
Okpara Avenue.
It was a very strategic piece of land at the commercial nerve center of the
future capital of Biafra, Enugu. The building that was erected had a few rooms—
one for Christopher, one for me, one for our secretary, one area for printing and
publishing machinery, and a smaller one was a toilet. Christopher made all the
arrangements himself. That was his nature: He would get the work done before
even broaching the subject, so that when you eventually agreed to his idea
(something he was sure you would), he would then release a torrent of
information, in this case about the office location, its design, and what the
building would cost us.
The first book we worked on was called How the Leopard Got Its Claws.

John Iroaganachi, a talented author, submitted a manuscript of a version of the
African myth “How the Dog Became a Domesticated Animal,” which Professor
Ernest Emenyonu relates “abounds in various versions in many African
cultures.”1 Christopher and I realized immediately that we wanted a different
story, more or less, and decided to spend some time on it. Iroaganachi’s story
transformed into something entirely different as I worked on it, and began to
take and find avenues and openings in a way that the original narrative hadn’t.
Christopher in particular was put off by the subservient character of the dog in
the original version and was delighted to see the next incarnation of the story. To
be certain that everyone was on the same page, Christopher asked Iroaganachi if
he was ready to see his original story transformed. Iroaganachi had no problem
with the changes we had suggested, and we settled on a joint authorship for our
first book, between me, John Iroaganachi, and Okigbo, who wrote a powerful
poem, “Lament of the Deer,” on my invitation.
Christopher was seen less often as the war intensified. I kept on working at
the office, and he came back whenever he had some time, and we discussed a
number of matters.2 The war clearly influenced the crafting of the new story. In
the second version the leopard is the king of animals and is a peaceful and wise
king. One day he is cast out by tyrants, led by the dog, into the cold, wet
wilderness. The leopard seeks help from the blacksmith, who makes teeth and
claws of steel for him, Thunder and Lightning, that grant him his roar and
strength. Then he returns to his kingdom to retake his throne, punish the
usurpers, and banish the dog to the services of man in perpetuity. In the end the
new story not only turned the ancient African fable on its head but also clearly
had manifestations of the Biafran story embedded in it.

The Ifeajuna Manuscript
Christopher and I encountered a wide variety of projects during our time at
Citadel Press. Emmanuel Ifeajuna, one of the so-called five majors who
executed the January 15, 1966, coup d’état, presented a manuscript to
Christopher, and he excitedly brought it to me. I too was excited to receive it; I
opened the package it came in and began to read it. It was the story of the
military coup. I read the treatise through quickly and became more and more
disappointed as I went along.
Ifeajuna’s account showcased a writer trying to pass himself off as something
that he wasn’t. For one, the manuscript claimed that the entire coup d’état was
his show, that he was the chief strategist, complete mastermind, and executer, not
just one of several. He recognized the presence of his coconspirators but did not
elevate their involvement to any level of importance.
The other problem I noted was the inconsistencies in the narrative. For
instance, the group of coup plotters are said to have met in a chalet at a catering
guest house in Enugu at night, and because what they were doing was very
dangerous, there was no light in the room, and they all sat in pitch darkness.
Despite the darkness, Ifeajuna, our narrator, goes on to say: “I stood up and
addressed them while watching their faces and noting their reactions.” The
whole account was replete with exaggerations that did not ring true.
I also struggled with the fact that the writer seemed not to appreciate the
seriousness of what he had done. Ifeajuna’s manuscript passed off the
assassination of the prime minister as light fare, as if it was all in good sport,
almost as if he was saying to his readers “I did this and I was right. I am a hero.”
When I saw Christopher Okigbo next I told him how impossible it was for
me to believe this account—I wanted to get a real sense of what really happened
on that fateful day in January 1966, not what Ifeajuna would want us to believe.
Christopher, having read the manuscript as well said, “I thought it was lyrical.”
He then told me that he bumped into Nzeogwu shortly after receiving the
manuscript, and Nzeogwu said to him: “I hear you and Achebe are planning to
publish Emma’s [Ifeajuna] lies.” That comment from Nzeogwu further placed
the manuscript in disrepute.

My own private conclusion was that Ifeajuna’s manuscript was an important
document, but it was not a responsible document. I believed Nzeogwu was right.
But, unfortunately for all of us, the manuscript seems to have disappeared, which
is not surprising considering what happened to all of the people involved in its
story. Ifeajuna and Nzeogwu are both dead, robbing us all of the opportunity of
reading two competing versions of what transpired. They are no longer here to
help fill this void. This is what gives me my only regret: I could have published
the manuscript and called it special publishing, as opposed to so-called regular
or mainstream publishing, so that at least a version of what happened, however
flawed, warts and all, would be available for debate.

Staying Alive
While I worked at the Citadel Press, Christie, with her characteristic ingenuity
and flair for design, created a home for us in this new city. When we arrived in
Enugu we quickly found accommodation on the outskirts of town. It was an
apartment complex with two subunits. We took the flat upstairs and converted
this empty space into a very livable, comfortable accommodation. She employed
a number of workers, including painters, masons, carpenters, and electricians,
over a short period of time in this miraculous feat of transformation. The other
tenant of this building was a charming architect. He too went ahead, and
architecturally altered the lower living quarters to meet his needs. We could
leave to the eye of the beholder whether this pleasant artist’s taste was eccentric
or eclectic. But one thing was clear: His new design did not go down well with
the landlord.
I put my family to bed one hot night toward the end of the renovation, and
opened a window to let a gentle, cool breeze in. At about 2:00 A.M. Christie first
heard the noise of an intruder. She alerted me, and I shouted at the top of my
voice, “Where is my gun?” We saw the outline of a figure in the dark dash past
us and jump through the open window. The intruder thankfully did not realize
that I did not possess a gun and was adamantly against the use of firearms. The
next day the workmen were one person short. When we asked where the missing
man was we were told that he had gone to the hospital to nurse a broken leg.

—
I traveled abroad soon after the move to Enugu, on a mission for the people of
Biafra. I asked my close friend Christopher Okigbo to take care of my family
while I was away. Christie was pregnant, and I turned my young family over to
Christopher for protection during this precarious time. In a quintessential
Christopher Okigbo move, he promptly checked them into the catering guest
house, a swank hotel chain of the day, first run smartly by the colonial British
government and then quite well by the government of the first republic of
Nigeria. This particular branch was now in the hands of the Biafrans and had, in
the words of Christopher, clearly an unbiased judge, “returned to its former

glory.” In any case, Christopher had connections with the manager and
introduced my wife and family as one of his own.
One day Christie asked Christopher to get her a number of things for lunch
from a nearby restaurant and said that she would “pay for it all.” She had a very
powerful craving for fried plantains, beans, and a delicacy called Isi Ewu.
Okigbo agreed to do so but instead telephoned the manager of the catering guest
house, telling him that Christie Achebe, who was pregnant, needed the food
items urgently, and that the food should be delivered to his room, and he would
then make sure it got to her. After waiting two to three hours, Christie called
Christopher about the food. Okigbo did not respond on the telephone but showed
up in their room with the explanation that he had inadvertently eaten it, thinking
it was a special lunch made for him. They could not believe it. On hearing this,
my three-year-old son, Ike, who had uncharacteristically, for someone his age,
been waiting patiently for lunch, launched at Okigbo, tackling him to the ground
and punching him with everything he had. Okigbo howled and feigned pain, and
then made sure he got my family a hearty dinner to eat.
I returned from my trip abroad to the news that my mother, who was quite
frail, had suddenly become quite sick. Her able and diligent physician, Dr.
Theophilus Mbanefo, had worked tirelessly to care for her, and now he thought it
best for her entire family to come back briefly and pay their “last respects.” I
was very close to my mother, and I sent Christie and my family ahead of me
while I worked through my private pain and wrapped up some business at the
Citadel Press. My family subsequently left with our driver, Gabriel, for Ogidi to
join the rest of my family at Mother’s bedside.
Christopher and I were working in this office of ours that morning, the first
day a military plane flew over Enugu. Our editorial chat was disturbed by the
sudden drone of an enemy aircraft overhead, and the hectic and ineffectual
small-arms fire that was supposed to scare it away, rather like a lot of flies
worrying a bull. Not a very powerful bull, admittedly, at that point in the
conflict. In fact, air raids were crude jokes that could almost be laughed off.
People used to say that the safest thing was to go out into the open and keep an
eye on the bomb as it was pushed out of the invading propeller aircraft. We
heard the sounds of more bombs exploding in the distance, and Christopher, who
already seemed familiar with planes and military hardware, shouted, “Under the
table!” Most of the other Biafrans were going about their business as usual,
unperturbed by this menace flying above their heads. As Christopher and I
listened uneasily, an explosion went off in the distance somewhere, and the

attack was soon over. We completed our discussion and departed. But that
explosion that sounded so distant from the Citadel offices was to bring him back
for a silent farewell on that eventful day.1
After the plane disappeared into the distance, Christopher said he had to
leave, and I went to check on something that was already in the press—the first
booklet that we were publishing for children. As I sat there working that day I
heard the sound of an aircraft above, followed by bedlam in the distance. I
shrugged this particular katakata, or chaos, off as another bombing raid from the
Nigerians and got on with my chores. I set out to visit a business colleague and
decided to stop at the house for a minute before proceeding to my original
destination. At the house I saw a huge crowd and realized that it was my
apartment complex that had been bombed!2
I pushed my way through the assembly to the edge of a huge crater in the
ground beside the building, about a hundred feet from my children’s swing set.
Luckily Christie and the children had left in the nick of time. Had there been
anyone in the house they would not have survived.3
Okigbo was standing among the crowd. I can still see him clearly in his
white gown and cream trousers among the vast crowd milling around my
bombed apartment, the first spectacle of its kind in the Biafran capital in the
second month of the war. I doubt that we exchanged more than a sentence or
two. There were scores of sympathizers pressing forward to commiserate with
me or praise God that my life or that the lives of my wife and children had been
spared. So I hardly caught more than a glimpse of him in that crowd, and then he
was gone like a meteor, forever. That elusive impression is the one that lingers
out of so many. As a matter of fact, he and I had talked for two solid hours that
very morning. But in retrospect that earlier meeting seems to belong to another
time.4
I set off after that brief encounter with Christopher, homeless, to see my
mother. My entire family was present in Ogidi, huddled, with long faces,
grieving. Women could be heard sobbing in the distance. Some, like my brother
Augustine, had just come in from Yaba, Lagos. Others, like Frank, our eldest
brother, had arrived from Port Harcourt, where he worked for the Post and
Telecommunications Corporation (P&T). I was informed soon after I got there
that Mother had asked to see us all. We trooped into her bedroom one at a time
and got to spend some private time with her. Soon after that, she passed away.
Our people report that her spirit called my family away from Enugu to save their
lives. I will not challenge their ancient wisdom.

Death of the Poet: “Daddy, Don’t Let Him
Die!”
I was driving from Enugu to Ogidi one afternoon, where I lived following the
bombing, with my car radio tuned to Lagos. Like all people caught in a modern
war, we had soon become radio addicts. We wanted to hear the latest from the
fronts; we wanted to hear what victories Nigeria was claiming next, not just from
NBC Lagos, but even more ambitiously, from Radio Kaduna. This station, also
known as Radio Nigeria, was notorious as the mouthpiece of the Nigerian
federal government; it only reported Nigerian military victories and successes,
and those of us caught in a conflict wanted to hear balanced, unbiased news. We
needed to hear what the wider world had to say to all that—the BBC, the Voice
of America, the French Radio, Cameroon Radio, Radio Ghana, Radio
Anywhere.
The Biafran forces had just suffered a major setback in the northern sector of
the war with the loss of the university town of Nsukka. They had suffered an
even greater morale-shattering blow with the death of that daring and enigmatic
hero who had risen from anonymity to legendary heights in the short space of
eighteen months: Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu. Christopher Okigbo had
begun to talk more and more about Nzeogwu before his enlistment, but I had not
listened very closely; the military did not fascinate me as it did him. In hindsight,
I wish I had listened—listened for all our sakes.
I was only half listening to the radio now when suddenly Christopher
Okigbo’s name stabbed my slack consciousness into panic life. “Rebel troops
wiped out by gallant Federal forces,” the announcement proclaimed. Among the
rebel officers killed: Major Christopher Okigbo.1
It’s rather different when a soldier is killed in battle—they get the body. I
don’t know what happens, but if they can identify him, and if they think they can
make capital out of it, they immediately announce it. The killing of officers is
something of which they are very proud. Christopher was a major.2
I pulled up at the roadside. The open parkland around Nachi stretched away
in all directions. Other cars came and passed. Had no one else heard the terrible
news?

When I finally got myself home and told my family, my three-year-old son,
Ike, screamed: “Daddy, don’t let him die!” Ike and Christopher had been special
pals. When Christopher came to the house the boy would climb on his knees,
seize hold of his fingers, and strive with all his power to break them while
Christopher would moan in pretended agony. “Children are wicked little devils,”
he would say to us over the little fellow’s head, and let out more cries of feigned
pain.3
Christopher fell in August 1967, in Ekwegbe, close to Nsukka, where his
poetry had come to sudden flower seven short years earlier. News of his death
sent ripples of shock in all directions. Okigbo’s exit was totally in character.
Given the man and the circumstance it was impossible for everyone to react to
the terrible loss in the same way. The varied responses, I think, would have
pleased Okigbo enormously, for he enjoyed getting to his destination through
different routes.4

—
I remember visiting Okpara Avenue, the site of the Citadel Press, soon after the
war, and I was appalled at the scale of destruction that had befallen that small
building. It is important to mention that a number of buildings in the vicinity had
been unscathed by the conflict, but this one was pummeled into the ground;
chips of the concrete blocks scattered everywhere had been pulverized as if with
a jackhammer. It was the work of someone or some people with an ax to grind. It
appeared as if there was an angry mission sent to silence the Citadel—for having
the audacity to publish How the Leopard Got Its Claws—a book that challenged
the very essence of the Nigerian federation’s philosophy, depicting the return of
the spurned former ruler to vanquish and retake his throne from the wretched
and conniving usurper. Having had a few too many homes and offices bombed, I
walked away from the site and from publishing forever.
A few months later my friends Arthur Nwankwo and Samuel Ifejika decided
to establish a publishing company that they called Nwamife Books. One of the
new company’s first publications was a compendium of stories that chronicled
the harrowing war years. I submitted a contribution to that important anthology,
and then took the opportunity to persuade them to publish How the Leopard Got
Its Claws. They agreed. The talented Scandinavian Per Christiansen illustrated
for the work, and effectively united the prose and poetry in a visual consonance.
I was grateful to see the manuscript Christopher and I had worked so hard on

back in print.

MANGO SEEDLING
Through glass windowpane
Up a modern office block
I saw, two floors below, on wide-jutting
concrete canopy a mango seedling newly sprouted
Purple, two-leafed, standing on its burst
Black yolk. It waved brightly to sun and wind
Between rains—daily regaling itself
On seed yams, prodigally.
For how long?
How long the happy waving
From precipice of rainswept sarcophagus?
How long the feast on remnant flour
At pot bottom?
Perhaps like the widow
Of infinite faith it stood in wait
For the holy man of the forest, shaggy-haired
Powered for eternal replenishment.
Or else it hoped for Old Tortoise’s miraculous feast
On one ever recurring dot of cocoyam
Set in a large bowl of green vegetables—
This day beyond fable, beyond faith?
Then I saw it
Poised in courageous impartiality
Between the primordial quarrel of Earth
And Sky striving bravely to sink roots
Into objectivity, midair in stone.
I thought the rain, prime mover
To this enterprise, someday would rise in power
And deliver its ward in delirious waterfall

Toward earth below. But every rainy day
Little playful floods assembled on the slab,
Danced, parted round its feet,
United again, and passed.
It went from purple to sickly green
Before it died.
Today I see it still—
Dry, wire-thin in sun and dust of the dry months—
Headstone on tiny debris of passionate courage.1

Refugees
Enugu fell to the Nigerian army a few months after Christopher fell in battle. I
fled to Umuahia with my family to stay with my sister-in-law, Elizabeth Okoli,
who had moved there from Aba. Lizzy was a nurse working in Umuahia-area
hospitals tending to the war wounded. Her story is quite remarkable: Lizzy was
educated at Queen’s College, Lagos, and in England, and was known in those
days as the “Queen of Sheba,” because of her grace and beauty. She was well
regarded for her clinical skills and her intellect and would become the chief
nursing officer of Anambra state in a new incarnation following the civil war.
Elizabeth was a bit of an enigma and an eccentric, and a former Mrs. Odumegwu
Ojukwu to boot, but she never wanted to talk about that! My brother Augustine
and his family were also in Umuahia. Shortly after our arrival, as I have
mentioned, I was sent abroad as an envoy for the people of Biafra. Christie
reports that Umuahia was subsequently strafed very close to where my family
was staying.
After the bombing that barely missed Lizzy’s residence, my family moved to
Ezinifite, a town north of Umuahia in the Aguata local government area of
present-day Anambra state. I returned from my short trip abroad and rejoined my
family there. It was there that we visited a family who in the past had sent one of
their sons to live with and be educated by my father.
Now we were refugees, and this family who had received the magnanimity
of my parents opened their homes and their resources to us—the three Achebe
families—Augustine’s, John’s, and mine—and we moved into the quarters
offered to us. It was a large estate. The head of the household lived in the largest
of about four houses. The sons, who were also married, had homes built within
the family compound. The sons gave each Achebe guest and their families a
room and a parlor.
Finding food in Ezinifite was a difficult proposition. The women had to wake
up very early in the morning—about 4:00 A.M.—to attend the daily markets to
procure food. When the Nigerians found out where the open markets were and
started bombing them, the women moved their commercial activities into dense
forests. Christie remembers one of the early morning markets she went to—the

villagers from the surrounding towns and hamlets would congregate in these
markets to sell their fresh vegetables, fruit and chicken, and other household
wares. If one had the money—one could use the Nigerian pound and the Biafran
pound interchangeably—there were a variety of expensive, locally grown
legumes, pawpaw, mangoes, bananas, and plantains, and other vegetables and
fruits to purchase. The traders coveted the Nigerian pound, because it was
particularly valuable in the black market and for purchasing and smuggling
goods and food across the border. The Nigerians bombed the market a day after
Christie visited the market. She remembers vividly:
The bombardment from the Nigerian Air Force on this day was particularly heavy, as
if the pilots had been upset at not discovering the market sooner. Most of the bombs
fell before dawn. In the morning we discovered the most harrowing of sights. One
image still haunts me till today: that of a pregnant woman split in two by the Nigerian
blitz. That was a horrendous experience for most of us, and we were all very
frightened after that.1

The Nigerian air force intensified its bombing exercises soon after this
incident. Word had reached the Biafran authorities that the Nigerians had
classified information about the location of civilian “hideout shelters.” Our hosts
were understandably concerned for our overall safety and built makeshift
bunkers throughout their compound. The bunkers were built of mud-and-clay
bricks and clearly were not structurally capable of withstanding a shelling, but
we were grateful nonetheless, because they were large, comfortable spaces
underground, away from the houses that would be obvious targets of the
Nigerian air force. Whenever we heard the siren we all rushed to the bunkers for
safety and waited out the air strikes.
The Biafran government had issued a public safety warning to all citizens to
abstain from wearing clothes of light colors like white or cream or sharp colors
such as orange, purple, or red that could be easily spotted by the Nigerian air
force. The Nigerian pilots approaching their chosen targets would often switch
off the engines of the planes, then fly very low—treetop level—before they
would begin the bombing onslaught. One could see that the plane crew was
pushing out these bombs with their hands, tossing them out from an open aircraft
door or shaft! Occasionally when the Nigerians used their aircraft guns to shoot
at civilian or military installations, we noticed that some of the bullet cases were
from large hunting ammo usually reserved for wild game.2
On this particular day we did not hear the siren or the planes; no one knew
that the Nigerians were in the air. When we noticed a plane zooming in for the

kill we rushed into the bunkers and looked around to account for everyone,
counting all the children. To our horror we realized that our third child, Chidi,
was not there.
We looked out and saw the toddler in his white diaper taking his time,
walking from the gate of the compound toward one of the houses. People tried to
prevent Christie from leaving the bunker to rescue the infant for fear that her
heroism might reveal the site of the bunker.
One said: “Leave him, he is innocent, nothing will happen to him.” Clearly
unconvinced and ignoring their advice, Christie dashed out from the bunker,
grabbed the baby, and arrived inside seemingly in time to avoid notice.
During our stay we had a number of confrontations not just with the Nigerian
army but with nature. As we ran from one zone of attack to another we often
ended up seeking shelter in mud huts deep in the hinterland. One particular
episode comes to mind: Christie had hung up a brown and black dress on a palm
frond door that opened into the room shielded by a thatch roof in a mud building
we were staying in. Exquisitely put together, these homes are ideal for the wet,
damp weather of the tropics and provide cool solace from the often
uncompromising elements.
The one downside of this ancient architecture is the fact that mud buildings
serve as an elaborate ecosystem of insects, arachnids, rodents, amphibians, and
reptiles—in other words, an entomologist’s and a zoologist’s dream! So on this
day, as Christie put on her dress, she received a sting that produced excruciating
pain. We rushed to her side and discovered that a centipede had engaged her skin
in a tenacious battle. The villagers quickly relieved her of the vermin with a hot
object warmed in a coal fire. Though we were reassured that this was not a
species that was poisonous, we slept in our car that night. We would have other
narrow escapes with scorpions, serpents, and blood-sucking larvae, and became
very vigilant.
My nephew, Uche Achebe, had left to join the army from our Ezinifite base
around this time. Uche, a bright lad, later became a surgeon and was at one point
the medical director of Nigeria’s National Orthopaedic Hospital in Enugu. In any
case, things were not working out very well for him in the army during this
period. Uche is a practical, rational person by temperament, and he noted that the
Nigerian army was quickly approaching, and there were so many bombings that
cost the lives of scores of Biafrans on a daily basis. He lamented the fact that the
Biafrans were not well equipped and appeared to be in perpetual retreat.
Compounding this desperate situation, he observed, was the fact that the Biafran

people were becoming disenchanted.
Unfortunately, Uche made his observations known to one of his fellow army
officers, saying something to the effect of: “If we are not able to do this, why
don’t we give up?” He was subsequently reported and arrested for treason. In the
end, after some intervention from several sources, he managed to escape courtmartial.
Irony plays a wicked game with life. The Nigerian army took over Ezinifite
very soon after the prophetic statements of my nephew, and we fled once again,
this time to the beautiful lakeside town of Oguta. We had a fairly quiet spell in
Oguta, because the Nigerians had been repulsed prior to our arrival. The locals
credited this victory to Ohamiri, the goddess of Lake Oguta, who protected the
Oguta people.
From time to time, one could hear the artillery shelling as the federal
government troops tried on multiple attempts to obliterate the Uli airport, which
was near Oguta. The federal troops at that point had not discovered that there
were two airports—Uli was the earlier one, which was very close to Oguta and
the nerve center of Biafran relief efforts. A second, smaller airport, less wellknown, was in Nnokwa and was also used for military missions.
Nnokwa is a little-known ancient village that played a vital role in Igbo
cosmology and in the development of its civilization. The townsfolk were
particularly noted for their role in the transmission of the knowledge of Nsibidi,
an ancient writing first invented by the Ejagham (Ekoi) people of southeastern
Nigeria, and then adopted and used widely by their close neighbors—the Igbo,
Efik, Anang, and Ibibio. The very existence of this alphabet, dating back to the
1700s without any Latin or Arabic antecedent, is a rebuke to all those who have
claimed over the centuries that Africa has no history, no writing, and no
civilization! But we always knew of the beauty of our culture, and one can
understand why Nnokwa was a place to be protected by the Biafrans at all costs.
In Oguta, we moved into my friend Ikenna Nzimiro’s uncle’s house—a huge
mansion. Some joked that it was as large as Buckingham Palace. One could see
that the mansion was virtually empty, as those who lived there, including the
staff, had all fled. The “mother of the house,” if you like, Nzimiro’s elderly
auntie, stayed behind with one or two of her attendants; she seemed ill and did
not appear very often. Nzimiro’s uncle had died several years before the conflict.
With her blessing we were given luxurious quarters and had quite a comfortable
stay.
It was during our sojourn in Oguta that Christie started a school to keep the

children of our hosts and the Achebe children engaged in their studies. Christie
had books that she had bought from shops, and she used these to teach the
children, with Chinelo, our first child and daughter. Each child started from the
last class they were in before the war broke out, and then graduated after they
completed the lesson plans. Despite the chaos and madness all around, some
privileged children, at least, still went to school.
From Oguta we would be driven out to the Shell compound, aka Shell Camp,
in Owerri after the city had been recaptured by the Biafrans. In the colonial era
Shell Camp was the residential quarters of some colonial officers and Shell
senior officials, before Royal Dutch/Shell BP moved their permanent quarters to
Port Harcourt in present-day Rivers state, in the Niger River Delta area. Shell
Camp in those days was a fairly lovely part of town, a neatly manicured estate
with well-maintained bungalows and lawns, telecommunications facilities, good
roads, and a reliable water supply.
Christie was expecting a baby and was ill during this time. She was moved to
a Roman Catholic hospital of high repute in the region, admitted by the
physician on staff, and cared for by the nursing sisters, a number of whom were
from Europe. We heard during her hospital stay that the Nigerians had finally
broken through the blockade mounted by the Biafran soldiers, rearmed, and
launched a second offensive, pushing closer to Owerri. It clearly had become
quite serious when we noticed Biafran soldiers coming into the hospital to warn
the clinical staff to leave and evacuate all the patients. Christie was summarily
discharged.
When we returned to Shell Camp we saw that the area had been infiltrated by
the Nigerian army, some wearing mufti, who watched us closely. We noticed that
the entire estate was almost deserted. The main roads were jammed with
civilians trying to escape before the Nigerian troops arrived. Some of the federal
forces who had already entered Owerri would snicker at the civilians; some
would wave cynically. It was eerie and frightening.
We picked up the few belongings we had in the house and jumped back into
the car. During the war years one never really unpacked; one always had the
belongings in the trunk of the car and took only the absolute necessities into the
temporary shelter that you found yourself in. We decided to get off the major
thoroughfares, so we meandered through the rural areas, villages, and hamlets
and arrived in the village of Okporo. This pleasant community holds a special
place in Biafran lore, because it was the site of a special hospital for children run
by Caritas, and it was one of the sites chosen to gather sick babies for the famous

airlift of Biafran babies to Gabon and Ivory Coast organized by international
relief agencies.
I recall visiting a clinic that had been hastily set up by one of the many
foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGO) during this time. They had
chosen an abandoned secondary school complex and set up shop in what must
have been the cafeteria. There were bullet holes in the limestone and concrete
walls and pieces of glass shattered on the floor, suggesting a recent gun battle.
The patients were strewn on the shiny red laterite floor on bamboo and raffia
mats—the adults in one section and the children in the other. It was raining on
that day, and the holes in the corrugated iron roofs provided a steady stream of
water that dripped directly on some patients (who appeared not to care) and
collected in puddles throughout the building. The visitor was greeted by the
strong smell of vomit, diarrhea, and other bodily fluids that are kept private in
sunnier times. In the distance one could hear the screams of pain from what
appeared to be a makeshift operating room, where surgeons performed
procedures with woefully limited anaesthesia.
There was a child in a corner who was being fed a white meal—the relief
meals were almost always white, I thought—and it was a concoction that meant
the difference between an early grave or another day to see the sun. On this day,
at least, this reed-thin child, with a skull capped with wiry rust-colored tufts of
hair and a body centered on a protuberant stomach, provided a toothy smile. I
spent a short while smiling back at her, and she reached out to touch my hand.
Her touch was as light as feathers.
Dr. Aaron Ifekwunigwe, now a professor emeritus of pediatrics at the
University of California, was the director of health services for Biafra at the time
of the war. He performed extensive and important clinical research and treatment
during this time. He studied the impact of starvation on the Biafran population.
One of his most compelling research projects, in March 1968, found during this
early period of starvation that 89 percent of those affected were children under
five years of age. The remaining 11 percent were age five to fifteen.3, 4
[On] an early fact-finding mission in 1968, conducted by ICRC [International
Committee of the Red Cross], Doctor Edwin Spirgi found that at least 300,000
children were suffering from kwashiorkor . . . and three million children were near
death.5

There was another epidemic that was not talked about much, a silent scourge
—the explosion of mental illness: major depression, psychosis, schizophrenia,
manic-depression, personality disorders, grief response, post-traumatic stress

disorder, anxiety disorders, etc.—on a scale none of us had ever witnessed. One
of the saddest images of the war was not just the dead and the physically
wounded but also the mentally scarred, the so-called mad men and women who
had been psychologically devastated by the anguish and myriad pressures of war.
They could often be seen walking seemingly aimlessly on the roads in tattered
clothes, in conversation with themselves.

WE LAUGHED AT HIM
We laughed at him our
hungry-eyed fool-man with itching
fingers that would see farther
than all. We called him
visionary missionary revolutionary
and, you know, all the other
naries that plague the peace, but
nothing would deter him.
With his own nails he cut
his eyes, scraped the crust
over them peeled off his priceless
patina of rest and the dormant
fury of his dammed pond
broke into a cataract
of blood tumbling down
his face and chest. . . . We
laughed at his screams the fool-man
who would see what eyes
are forbidden, the hungry-eyed
man, the look-look man, the
itching man bent to drag
into daylight fearful signs
hidden away from our safety
at the creation of the world.
He was always against
blindness, you know, our quiet
sober blindness, our lazy—he called
it—blindness. And for
his pains? A turbulent, torrential

cascading blindness behind
a Congo river of blood. He sat
backstage then behind his flaming red
curtain and groaned in
the pain his fingers unlocked, in the
rainstorm of blows loosed on his head
by the wild avenging demons he
drummed free from the silence of their
drum-house, his prize for big-eyed greed.
We sought by laughter to drown
his anguish until one day
at height of noon his screams
turned suddenly to hymns
of ecstasy. We knew then his pain
had risen to the brain
and we took pity on him
the poor fool-man as he held
converse with himself. “My Lord,”
we heard him say to the curtain
of his blood, “I come to touch
the hem of your crimson robe!”
He went stark mad thereafter
raving about new sights he
claimed to see, poor fellow; sights
you and I know are as impossible for this world
to show as for a hen to urinate—if one
may borrow one of his many crazy vulgarisms—
he raved about trees topped with
green and birds flying—yes actually
flying through the air—about
the Sun and the Moon and stars
and about lizards crawling on all
fours. . . . But nobody worries much
about him today: he has paid
his price and we don’t even
bother to laugh any more.1

The Media War
The Nigeria-Biafra War was arguably the first fully televised conflict in history.
It was the first time scenes and pictures—blood, guts, severed limbs—from the
war front flooded into homes around the world through television sets, radios,
newsprint, in real time. It probably gave television evening news its first chance
to come into its own and invade without mercy the sanctity of people’s living
rooms with horrifying scenes of children immiserated by modern war.
One of the silver linings of the conflict (if one can even call it that) was the
international media’s presence throughout the war. The sheer amount of media
attention on the conflict led to an outpouring of international public outrage at
the war’s brutality. There were also calls from various international agencies for
action to address the humanitarian disaster overwhelming the children of Biafra.1
Said Baroness Asquith in the British House of Lords, “[Thanks to the
miracle of television we see history happening before our eyes. We see no Igbo
propaganda; we see the facts.”2 Following the blockade imposed by the Nigerian
government, “Biafra” became synonymous with the tear-tugging imagery of
starving babies with blown-out bellies, skulls with no subcutaneous fat harboring
pale, sunken eyes in sockets that betrayed their suffering.3
Someone speaking in London in the House of Commons, or the House of
Lords, would talk about history happening all around them, but for those of us
on the ground in Biafra, where this tragedy continued to unfold, we used a
different language . . . the language and memory of death and despair, suffering
and bitterness.
The agony was everywhere. The economic blockade put in place by
Nigeria’s federal government resulted in shortages of every imaginable
necessity, from food and clean water to blankets and medicines. The rations had
gone from one meal a day to one meal every other day—to nothing at all.
Widespread starvation and disease of every kind soon set in. The suffering of the
children was the most heart wrenching.

Narrow Escapes
At another stop, in the town of Okporo, we met a very pleasant gentleman who
took my entire family in. He offered Christie and me the only finished room in
the mud house he was still building. The rest of the floors were yet to be
plastered. He moved out his belongings from the finished room and moved our
things into it. We argued with him, but he would not hear it, and insisted that we
stay in his most comfortable room. We more or less settled in.
One was not sure where the war was headed, so we decided to stay in
Okporo for as long as our hosts would have us. There was a great deal of
confusion about the status of the republic. This was at the tail end of the conflict.
At that point in the hostilities, both sides were really exhausted. One noticed it in
the shuffling gait of the soldiers, in the less than chipper drill-song choruses, in
the number of stories of army desertions.
The news about surrender was already in the air. Tragically, there were many
false rumors that the war had ended. Some people who had survived the war lost
their lives that week because they had heard that people were being asked to
come back to Enugu, that everything was over and returning to normal. Some of
them were killed by Nigerian troops on the way.
The federal troops soon arrived in Okporo and broke our idyllic village
existence. With their arrival came the horrendous stories of nurses and local
women being raped and violated in unthinkable ways.1
One day the Nigerian soldiers came to the compound, and we hid our
daughter, Chinelo, who was eight. I was in the kitchen making bread in the earth
(laterite) oven that we had designed. I watched the soldiers from the kitchen
window for a while as they pranced around the compound and demanded that its
owner hand over a large black-and-white-spotted goat that was tied to the fence,
in a corner near a building that served as the storage area. The animal was
oblivious of the soldiers’ menacing presence and busy chewing cud, its jaw
swaying from side to side in between nibbles of long strands of elephant grass.2
The goat had sentimental importance to the wife of the owner of the
residence, we learned from her pleas. It had been a gift from her father, so she
refused to hand over the animal to the soldiers. I talked to the soldiers for a

while, overwhelmed by the strong smell of Kai Kai, a local gin, on their breath,
and in Igbo persuaded the wife of our host to give the soldiers the animal or be
willing to lose her life and ours in the process.
A small crowd had gathered to watch this spectacle. The soldiers at this point
were showing off, pointing their rifles in our faces. As they marched off they
instructed the animal’s owner to take care of the goat for them in their absence,
because they were still on duty. If the goat was not there when they came back,
they warned, “you will all be responsible.”
As soon as the soldiers left the wife of our host, in a state of panic, untied the
goat from the fence with the intention of hiding it in a dry well nearby. I called
out to her to leave the goat alone.
“Let them take it,” I said, “and leave you alone.” Fortunately for everyone
the soldiers never returned for the war plunder.

—
I had the privilege of having an official car that had been assigned to me by the
government of Biafra, which came with a driver. The driver was one of those
hyperreligious individuals who wore only white (a sign of purity, apparently)
and preached endlessly to his company, condemning everyone and everything
“to the damnation that awaitest thee if you don’t repent!” He was a truly curious
character but an excellent driver nonetheless.
One morning, as we woke to the greeting of the cock crow in the distance, I
walked out to the brisk damp dawn, stretched, and smiled as I glanced around—
the villages in Nigeria always had an organic, wholesome, earthy smell to them
—and then it struck me: I noticed that the government vehicle had disappeared.
Someone in the yard confirmed that the government driver had packed the entire
car in the wee hours of the morning and fled with our belongings.
We had traveled up to that point in a two-car convoy—I drove my own car, a
Jaguar, and the official car was driven by the chauffeur. Luckily, we still had the
Jaguar, and we decided to leave Okporo with our own driver, who we knew was
much more trustworthy. We took the other driver’s disappearance as some sort of
omen, thanked our hosts for their wonderful hospitality, and departed in the early
afternoon with the intention of traveling back to Ogidi, my ancestral home. We
headed north toward Onitsha, six miles from Ogidi. It was getting quite dark by
the time we got to the outskirts of Oba, a few miles from Otu-Onitsha.
Refined petroleum was available but not always readily accessible, and

petrol depots were obvious targets of the federal troops. The driver reported that
we had an empty gas tank and we were desperately in need of filling up the tank
if we were to make the rest of the trip without incident. Almost immediately we
heard the vehicle wobble and then just stop. A deep darkness had enveloped us
—there was no moonlight, so it seemed even darker—and our circumstances
made the darkness seem even more ominous. We knew that one never ventured
into canteens or restaurants for fear of meeting one’s death at the hands of
drunken soldiers. We decided that we would spend the night in the car.
In the middle of the night some young men started walking around the car—
circling menacingly. They had come out of a restaurant, where they had been
drinking, staggering clumsily and laughing and speaking at the top of their
voices. We were very frightened. The driver and I got out of the car and started
pushing the vehicle, for quite some time, until we encountered some Biafran
soldiers in a jeep. The captain recognized me and advised us not to travel any
farther this particular night, and he got his men to help us push the car the rest of
the way to a petrol depot, where we filled our gas tank, parked the car at the
corner, and passed the night there. The next morning we set out very early,
gradually, moving in occasional spurts and starts, since the fuel in the car’s tank
clearly was adulterated. Not for the last time, we were happy to be unscathed.

The Fight to the Finish
By the rainy season of 1968, Gowon’s three-pronged attack had surrounded
millions of civilians who were harbored in a narrow corridor around Umuahia.
He was counting on a strategy of decisive force to which the Biafrans responded
with a classic guerrilla war strategy out of Che Guevara’s playbook.
The Biafrans surprised the Nigerians with their perseverance.
Overwhelmingly outgunned, Philip Effiong’s army was able to withstand the
attack by breaking conflict zones into classic smaller wars, where the few arms
he had would prove more effective. This strategy required “no front lines, a
reliance on small unit operations and great individual discipline.”1

The Economic Blockade and Starvation
The Biafrans paid a great humanitarian price by ceding a great deal of territory
to the Nigerians and employing this war strategy. The famine worsened as the
war raged, as the traditional Igbo society of farmers could not plant their crops.
Gowon had succeeded in cutting Biafra off from the sea, robbing its inhabitants
of shipping ports to receive military and humanitarian supplies. The afflictions
marasmus and kwashiorkor began to spread farther, with the absence of protein
in the diet, and they were compouded by outbreaks of other disease epidemics
and diarrhea. The landscape was filled by an increasing number of those avian
prognosticators of death as the famine worsened and the death toll mounted:
udene, the vultures. By the beginning of the dry season of 1968, Biafran civilians
and soldiers alike were starving. Bodies lay rotting under the hot sun by the
roadside, and the flapping wings of scavengers could be seen circling, waiting,
watching patiently nearby. Some estimates are that over a thousand Biafrans a
day were perishing by this time, and at the height of Gowon’s economic
blockade and “starve them into submission�� policy, upward of fifty thousand
Biafran civilians, most of them babies, children, and women, were dying every
single month.
Ojukwu seized upon this humanitarian emergency and channeled the Biafran
propaganda machinery to broadcast and showcase the suffering to the world. In
one speech he accused Gowon of a “calculated war of destruction and
genocide.”1 Known in some circles as the “Biafran babies” speech, it was hugely
effective and touched the hearts of many around the world. This move was
brilliant in a couple of respects. First, it deflected from himself or his war cabinet
any sentiments of culpability and outrage that might have been welling up in the
hearts and minds of Biafrans, and second, it was yet another opportunity to cast
his arch nemesis, Gowon, in a negative light.2
Ojukwu dispatched several of his ambassadors to world capitals, hoping to
build on the momentum from his broadcast. His envoys received little new
support or pledges. Frustrated by the obstacles he found in coaxing a more proBiafra policy from the United States, Sir Louis Mbanefo famously rebuked the
Americans, saying:

We are especially resentful of the ambivalent pretenses the United States makes, that it
is trying to help us. . . . If we are condemned to die, all right, we will die. But at least
let the world, and the United States, be honest about it.3

Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, Nigerian and Biafran envoys
were meeting with His Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia to
sort out the modality of air and land transport for relief supplies to Biafra.4 The
diplomatic battles had reached a fever pitch by the middle of 1968. Gowon,
under immense international pressure and bristling from the whirlwind of
publicity about Biafra, decided to open up land routes for a “supervised
transport” of relief. To the consternation of Gowon, Ojukwu opted out of land
routes in favor of increased airlifts of food from São Tomé by international relief
agencies. Ojukwu, like many Biafrans, was concerned about the prospect that the
Nigerians would poison the food supplies.5

The Silence of the United Nations
Biafrans had their own reasons to lament the death of the widely respected
secretary general of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjöld, who was killed in
an air crash in September 1961. The Burmese diplomat U Thant, selected to
replace him, would lead the UN from 1961 to 1971. Unlike Dag Hammarskjöld,
who was an expert at conflict resolution, and a humanist, U Thant was a
decidedly different kind of man.1
A noninterventionist who deferred to local bodies such as the Organization of
African Unity for policy advice and guidance, U Thant provided the OAU a
great deal of latitude in decision making and implementation. An argument
could be made for this stance, at least at the beginning of the conflict, but as the
humanitarian catastrophe worsened, leading ultimately to the starvation and
death of millions, even the most committed anarchist would have expected
greater United Nations involvement. That did not happen, and I and several
others believe that had the United Nations been more involved, there would not
have been as many atrocities, as much starvation, as much death.
In October 1969, when Ojukwu reached out desperately to the United
Nations to “mediate a cease-fire as a prelude to peace negotiations,”2 his pleas
were met with a deafening silence. U Thant turned to the Nigerians for direction.
Gowon insisted on Biafra’s surrender, and he observed that “rebel leaders had
made it clear that this is a fight to the finish and that no concession will ever
satisfy them.”3
This was a calculated strategy from the Nigerians, who now had the
international cloak of the United Nations under which to commit a series of
human rights violations. Failing to end the protracted Biafran guerrilla offensive,
the Nigerian army openly attacked civilians in an ill-advised, cruel, and
desperate attempt to incite internal opposition to the war and build momentum
toward a quick surrender.4
The vacuum in moral and humanitarian leadership from the United Nations
meant that the Nigerian federal government could operate with reckless
abandon, without appropriate monitoring from international agencies. There
would be precious little proof of the wartime atrocities had it not been for private

nongovernmental agencies and individuals. In February 1969 alone nearly eight
hundred civilians were massacred by targeted Nigerian air force strikes on open
markets near Owerri—Umuohiagu and Ozu-abam. The Nigerian air force pilots
were particularly noteworthy for not respecting Geneva Convention resolutions
describing civilian safe havens, such as hospitals, refugee and food distribution
camps, and centers of religious worship.
In an article called “Who Cares About Biafra Anyway?” that was published
in the Harvard Crimson, Jeffrey D. Blum described the horrors witnessed by
Harvard University School of Public Health professor Jean Mayer:
Distribution centers and refugee camps are bombed and strafed if any large numbers
of people are visible in the daylight. Red Cross insignias are singled out for special
attention by Nigerian bombers. Mayer saw one European engaged in working on the
Biafran side of the war front carrying 117 dying children in his truck to a hospital in a
single night.5

These air strikes backfired for Nigeria, further eroding international support for
their war effort. Ojukwu seized on this opportunity, releasing a statement to the
international press following an address to the consultative assembly in
Umuahia. He lambasted the federal troops for having “begun a last desperate
effort in the form of a land army pogrom.” Ojukwu categorically denied any
attempts by the Biafrans to surrender and reported that there would be an
increased emphasis on the cultivation of staple crops to meet the mounting food
needs of the starving Biafrans.
Many of us wondered where and how exactly this “cultivation” would take
place, given the fact that the land mass controlled by Biafra was at this point of
the conflict a fraction of its original size. Ojukwu clearly intended to try to feed
the starving masses. It was important to him for Biafrans to see him making an
effort even if he failed at achieving his lofty goals. Many listening on the Biafran
side were willing to receive this food for thought even if there was no food for
their stomachs. Ojukwu also warned the government of Harold Wilson of Great
Britain that the British will “forfeit all holdings in Eastern Nigeria” if it
continued to provide military and logistical aid to the Nigerians.6
Wilson’s government was feeling the heat of the glaring lights of
international media scrutiny. On one of my trips to London, on August, 12, 1968,
I was an eyewitness to one of the debates on the Biafran issue in the House of
Commons, and I came away with this impression: If government was largely
unmoved by the tragedy, ordinary people were outraged. I witnessed from the
visitors’ gallery what was described as “unprecedented rowdiness” during a

private members’ motion on Biafra. Harold Wilson, villain of the peace, sat cool
as a cucumber, leaving his foreign secretary, Michael Stewart, to sweat it out. It
was hardly surprising that many remarkable people would want to visit the scene
of such human tragedy.7
Harold Wilson was concerned that the growing opposition to his Nigeria
policy might cause him to lose the next general election. He tried to assuage
domestic and international opinion by planning an elaborate trip to Nigeria.
Baroness Castle famously and aptly described Lord Wilson as “indulging in his
near fatal weakness for gestures as a substitute for action.”8 By the time Harold
Wilson arrived at the theater that he had set on fire on March, 29, 1969, he chose
to do so in an “11,000 tonne amphibious assault ship called Fearless with an
extra platoon of marines aboard.”9
Claiming to have arrived to negotiate a peace between the warring parties,
Lord Wilson met only with Gowon, extending a Trojan invitation to Ojukwu—to
meet outside Nigeria, on Nigerian ground, or on the British ship Fearless
anchored in the Lagos Lagoon. As a meeting in Biafra was not one of the
choices, all the options were unsatisfactory to the Biafrans, who turned down the
purely political invitation.10
Like the cruel deception of locusts that appear from a distance as a welcome
visit of dark clouds gorged with rain, Lord Wilson failed to deliver on any
resolution to help end the Nigeria-Biafra conflict and left the land stripped bare
of what many felt was the last substantive hope of peace.

Azikiwe Withdraws Support for Biafra
Beyond the military histrionics, there were a number of important attempts at
peace made by several local and international statesmen, including Nnamdi
Azikiwe, Nigeria’s first president, who called on the United Nations to help end
the conflict in Nigeria. In a speech at Oxford University on February 16, 1969,
the former president and a one-time emissary of Biafra outlined a fourteen-point
peace plan to be implemented by a proposed “UN peace keeping force made up
of international and local peace keeping forces” that would stay on the ground
for at least a year during the implementation of both a cease-fire and peaceful
resolution of ethnic, economic, and political tensions. Azikiwe’s proposals also
called on Nigeria and Biafra to sign a modus vivendi “to be enforced by the
Security Council of the United Nations.”1
Azikiwe’s lecture could not have come at a more critical time. I remember
many of us in Biafra were hoping that his intervention would bring about a
breakthrough in the stalemate. That hope was crushed when, following his
triumphant lecture at Oxford, his strategy, which was submitted to both United
Nations officials and the federal government of Nigeria, was soundly rejected as
“unworkable.”
It is instructive to note that many of Azikiwe’s strategies and suggestions—
international conflict resolution with United Nations peacekeeping forces, the
use of international observer teams and military personnel to complement
existing resources on the ground, etc.—have become standard United Nations
practices today. Nevertheless, exactly six months later Nnamdi Azikiwe decided
to discontinue any public support for the secessionist aspirations of Biafra and
turned in his diplomatic credentials.
There has been a great deal of speculation as to why Azikiwe withdrew his
support for Biafra. He was in a tough position and made a very difficult decision
after his counsel went mostly ignored by Ojukwu. The late Dr. Okechukwu
Ikejiani provides for posterity a rare insight into Azikiwe’s thinking,
apprehension, and intellectual struggle:
His [Azikiwe’s] feeling was that when a leader of a nation wants to go to war, he
should consult people. Primarily Ojukwu should have consulted Zik. Secondly, he

should have consulted [Michael] Okpara [premier of eastern Nigeria]. Thirdly, he
should have consulted other leaders. The only people that Ojukwu consulted were
[Louis] Mbanefo and [Francis] Ibiam. I have Ibiam’s letter here. It was a great
mistake. I told Ojukwu [to] invite these people [and inform them]. He told me they
would compromise. That’s what he said. He didn’t invite them, never asked them
questions. That’s not how to lead. That’s what led us into trouble. There are many
areas we would have compromised. Ojukwu did not compromise. That’s one of the
mistakes we made in the war. . . . It wasn’t that Zik opposed the war. Anybody with an
intellect, with a sense would consider carefully the implications of a war. War is
destructive. There’s no country that went to war that didn’t suffer, not one. When we
went to war, we destroyed everything we had. That’s true.2

One must also remember that Azikiwe had spent his entire life first fighting
for Nigerian independence under the One Nigeria mantra. In a curious twist of
irony he found the same position manipulated by the British he had helped oust
from his homeland. To add insult to injury, Azikiwe watched helplessly as the
words he helped invent were then used by the Nigerian army—made up of some
of the very same people who from the get-go had rejected the concept of a
unified Northern and Southern Nigeria. Azikiwe supporters allege that the
refusal by Ojukwu to consider many peaceful strategies to end the conflict,
coupled with the prospects of annihilation of his people, was, I was told, just too
much for the “great Zik of Africa” to bear.

The Recapture of Owerri
The psychologically devastated Biafrans were wrestling with two dire prospects
in the latter part of the Harmattan Season of 1969: mass starvation or death by
organized “ethnic cleansing” at the hands of Gowon’s military. A third
possibility, surrender, was not in the cards. By this time there were close to one
hundred thousand men, women, and children, mainly children, perishing every
six weeks. The Biafrans would get an emotional reprieve at the news of the
recapture of Owerri, one of Biafra’s largest cities, from the Nigerian troops.1
Gowon was furious to learn that Owerri had fallen back into the hands of the
army he had sworn to defeat in three months. He instituted a major
reorganization of his army’s leadership. The Nigerian Third Battalion was now
to be commanded by Olusegun Obasanjo, the Second Division switched
commanders from Haruna to Lieutenant Colonel Gibson Sanda Jalo, and the
First Battalion was now led by Brigadier Iliya Bisalla, in place of Shuwa.
The next several weeks saw an energized Biafran army engage the federal
troops with heightened vigor. They were able to keep the Nigerian army at bay
on several fronts—across the Imo River; through Uzuakoli to the seat of power
in Umuahia and around the perimeter of Owerri, Nekede; and on the road to
Aba. Colonel Joseph Achuzia, who had been placed in charge of the Biafran
offensive by Ojukwu, even contemplated a major military push to Port Harcourt.
The lack of ammunition or military supplies made this lofty goal a suicide
mission, and even the radical Joseph “Air Raid” Achuzia knew his limitations.2
Achuzia was one of the most complicated, some say eccentric characters of
the war. He was well-known throughout the East as a “no-nonsense, disciplined,
tactical and strategic military genius,” and was highly respected, if not feared by
the Nigerian federal forces for his mastery of guerrilla warfare and for giving
them a “run for their money” on the battlefield. Military experts report that
Achuzia remained Ojukwu’s “ace commander” throughout the conflict, and he
was often called upon to solve problems or build upon military theater
advantages. His detractors, who refer to him as “a war zealot,” provide the
counterpoint that no action on the battlefield should be elevated to the level of
“genius,” and that Achuzia’s desire for military discipline often, allegedly, meant

shooting a number of Biafran soldiers in order to get the others to fall in line.3
Achuzia survived the conflict and was appointed the secretary general of the
influential pan-Igbo group Ohaneze NdiIgbo in later years.

Biafra Takes an Oil Rig: “The Kwale
Incident”
In the middle of the rainy season of 1969, Biafran military intelligence allegedly
obtained information that foreign oilmen, particularly staff from the Italian
government’s oil conglomerate, Eni,1 were aiding the Nigerian army. The foreign
workers were allegedly providing sensitive military information to the federal
forces—about Biafran troop positions, strategic military maneuvers, and
training.
This information was quickly made available to the Biafran command, which
swiftly sent soldiers on a stealth dawn operation during which they invaded Eni’s
combine in Kwale, in the Niger River Delta’s oil reserve known as Okpai oil
field. By the end of the “exercise” eleven workers had been killed—ten of the
dead were Italian and one was from Jordan. The Biafrans took eighteen Eni
employees hostage. Fourteen were Italian, three were German, and one was
Lebanese. What happened next would stir international outrage of epic
proportions and threaten the fragile emotional and moral support that the
Biafrans had developed during the course of the war.
The men were quickly detained on Biafran soil, tried, and found guilty of
supporting the enemy—the federal troops of Nigeria—to wage a war of
genocide. Predictably, there was a spontaneous outcry and appeals for clemency
from disparate groups and countries. The Vatican and the embassies of Italy,
Germany, Portugal, and Biafra’s African supporters—Ivory Coast and Gabon—
were at the vanguard of those asking for the release of the prisoners.2
Biafra’s local and international supporters were dismayed. One observer
commented at the time: “This indeed was not what the cause was about. . . .
[W]e were engaged in a fight for self-determination. . . . [T]his was an
unnecessary and costly distraction.”3 Biafran officials were adamant, even
obstinate; the enclave’s minister for information, Ifegwu Eke, had this to say
about the incident: “Oilmen are more dangerous than mercenaries. . . . These are
the people responsible for our suffering.” Ojukwu’s own radio pronouncements
about the incident were equally irascible:

Oscillating amid impassioned outrage and constrained eloquence, the Biafran leader
exclaimed: “For 18 white men, Europe is aroused. What have they said about our
millions? Eighteen white men assisting in the crime of genocide. What do they say
about our murdered innocents? How many black dead make one missing white?
Mathematicians, please answer me. Is it infinity?”4

After Ojukwu received a private letter from the pope in June 1969,
personally pleading for the release of the oilmen, many in Ojukwu’s inner circle
were concerned about an international backlash. If the situation was not resolved
swiftly, they feared, it could precipitate an instant sinking of Biafra’s
international reputation and a permanent loss of Vatican, Italian, indeed
international humanitarian support. Eventually, in late June 1969, the eighteen
detained men were released and flown out of Biafra in the custody of diplomats
from the Ivory Coast and Gabon.
Some scholars believe that Ojukwu’s calculation was that a combination of
Biafran military resistance and the disruption of oil operations in the region
would reduce oil revenue flowing to Nigeria’s supporters and into the Nigerian
treasury, crippling their war machinery and bringing about an accelerated
negotiation to end the war.5 Others are less charitable and feel that the whole
affair was a blunder for the record books; they ascribe Ojukwu’s decision to free
the men as informed as much by the pope’s letter as by the prospect of Italian
“armed intervention to free their citizens”6—and his own rapid tumble from
power in such a scenario.
Be that as it may, the fact that seemed to have completely escaped the
Biafran leaders was this: As a people proclaiming victimization at the hands of
Nigeria, and rightfully so, we could not be seen as victimizers in any situation or
setting, in order to continue receiving the widespread moral and humanitarian
support we needed to survive. This failure to recognize this fundamental
principle, I believe, contributed immensely to the downturn in Biafra’s fortunes.
I personally believe that this fiasco was the clearest evidence of the mental
fatigue of the Biafran military leadership.

The summer of 1969 would prove a busy one on the diplomatic front. Pope Paul
VI, buoyed by the success of his emissaries in diffusing the Kwale incident,
focused his energies next on procuring a lasting peace between the warring
parties. During an official trip to Uganda the pontiff met the Biafran and
Nigerian emissaries separately in lengthy talks, during which he expressed his

desire that a peaceful resolution be found.7
The pontiff addressed the Ugandan Parliament on August 10, following an
exhausting ceremony during which he consecrated twelve new African bishops,
and repeated the Vatican’s desire to mediate a lasting peace between Nigeria and
Biafra:
[I]n a region of Africa dear to us . . . there still rages an agonizing conflict. . . . We
have not only sought to secure goods and medical assistance, impartially and by every
means available, but have also tried to apply the remedy of a certain initial
reconciliation. Up to now we have not succeeded and this gives us heartfelt pain. But
we are resolved to continue our modest but affectionate and fair efforts of persuasion
to help heal this fatal dissension.8

In America, the Nixon administration increased diplomatic pressure on the
Gowon administration to open up avenues for international relief agencies at
about the same time, following months of impasse over the logistics of supply
routes. Many congressmembers, government officials, indeed lay citizens were
increasingly exasperated by the endless streaming television imagery of dying
Biafran babies, and by the blockade imposed by the Gowon government. Biafra
had in Senator Edward M. Kennedy a humane and sympathetic ear. Kennedy
called for early and sustained U.S. humanitarian intervention throughout the
bloody conflict.9 Strom Thurmond, a senator from South Carolina, also became
particularly vocal about America’s intention to continue providing relief supplies
to the needy irrespective of the Nigerian federal government’s obstinate
blockade measures.10
Thurmond, an unlikely supporter of the breakaway Republic of Biafra, was a
former “‘Dixiecrat”11—a member of the conservative base of the “old
Democratic party of the 1950s and early 1960s” that fled to the safety of the
Republican Party following the reverberations of the civil rights period. He also
had a not too flattering reputation for commandeering the filibuster of the Civil
Rights Act of 1957. He was, however, a well-respected and high-profile
congressman and a particularly effective legislator—all the characteristics that
the desperate Biafrans needed.12
Biafran diplomats began to see some of the repercussions of the Kwale
incident by the end of 1969, and the erosion of the goodwill that had been built
up so successfully over the previous twenty-seven months. Neutral countries like
Canada, hitherto officially silent, more or less, while engaged in spirited
humanitarian support of the suffering, openly criticized the Ojukwu
administration as one “that was more interested in getting arms than food or

medical supplies and had made up reasons for rejecting [humanitarian aid].”13
For the Biafrans, particularly those of us who had made trips to Canada to secure
their humanitarian support, this rhetoric was particularly devastating.

1970 and The Fall
In Biafra, the Harmattan Season leading into 1970 was particularly harsh. I
remember vividly the suffering of the people; everything seemed particularly
bleak. The dry, sandy air seemed to be an additional torment, delighting in
covering the body with layers of the Sahara Desert’s fine dust, blown in from
hundreds of miles away. This made it impossible for bare, weeping, vulnerable
skin lesions to heal. It was particularly hard on the children. Looking around one
could see a proud, devastated people.
The Nigerians at this point were also worried about the physical and
psychological impact that this war was having on their troops. The federal
government, it was well-known, increased the recruitment of a great number of
mercenaries from the neighboring countries of Chad and Niger, and from far
away Mali, to supplement their numbers. The federal ranks were also plagued by
widespread dissatisfaction with the war effort, the escalating number of
casualties, and the lack of a clear vision for ending the conflict. To make matters
worse for Gowon, the general population had grown impatient with what now
appeared to be an endless conflict that had entered its thirtieth month.
Gowon was clearly in a bind. He responded to this predicament by sending
off secret memos to relay the details of his final offensive, a scorched-earth
policy to crush the Biafran resistance once and for all. By the middle of January
1970, the Nigerian troops had regained the upper hand decisively. Biafra, for all
terms and purposes was crushed emotionally, psychologically, financially, and
militarily, and it came crashing down soon after the new year began.
After failing many times over the thirty-month period, Gowon finally had
Biafra surrounded on three fronts. In mid-January 1970, after Owerri had been
recaptured by the federal troops and Uli airport was under heavy air and land
assault by federal troops led by Olusegun Obasanjo, I knew the end for Biafra
was near. That feeling was confirmed for millions of others in Biafra when
Ojukwu went on the radio and announced that he was “leaving the People’s
Republic of Biafra to explore alternative options for peace.” We all learned later
that he had traveled to Ivory Coast, one of Biafra’s early African supporters,
where his longtime friend president Félix Houphouët-Boigny, with French

backing, had offered him asylum. Nigeria mounted attempts to repatriate
Ojukwu for at least five years following the war in order to try him for war
crimes, but they failed mainly because the French made access to him
impossible.
After that announcement there was sheer pandemonium throughout Biafra.
Millions of Biafrans could be seen scrambling to get away from the Nigerian
military forces, which at this point seemed to be advancing from every direction.
Many of the classic Time and Life photos of this era were taken during this time
of great panic, despair, and anxiety.
There have been several debates over the decades since about why Ojukwu,
the resistance leader of a people so wronged, left (some say fled) Biafra at this
critical juncture, declaring in his classic style: “Whilst I live, Biafra lives.”1 His
detractors, many of whom are still alive, still believe that this particular act was
one of great cowardice, and that true heroes go down with the cause.
I think Ojukwu’s departure, like many things that he did before, during, and
after the war, was a complicated matter. It was clear to the Biafran leader that the
end was near, that his troops had been defeated, at least militarily, and that the
mostly Igbo Easterners on whose behalf he had waged this war were broken in
every respect and were standing at the precipice of annihilation. By taking
himself out of the equation, so to speak, Ojukwu robbed his old nemesis Gowon
of the war booty he sought the most—his head. Therefore, the protracted internal
rivalry between the two men that I have referred to had no resolution, and he had
robbed Gowon of closure and complete satisfaction in victory. Indeed, many
psychologists believe that Gowon may not have been as conciliatory as he ended
up being had Ojukwu stayed behind.
Gowon does not stray far from my conclusions on this subject:
What you should remember about the time—and, at least, give us some credit for it—
is that we did not take what would be considered normal action under such
circumstances. In such an instance, all the senior officials involved—politicians as
well as in the military—would have been strung up for their part in the war. This is
what happened at the end of the Second World War in Germany; it happened in Japan
at the end of the campaign in that part of the world. This is the civilized world’s way
of doing things. But we did not do even that. We did set up committees to look into
cases such as where rebel officers had been members of the Nigerian Armed Forces,
and their loyalty was supposed to be to the Federal Government. When the war ended,
we reabsorbed practically everyone who was in the Army. But there were officers at a
certain senior level [who] we insisted had to accept responsibility for their role in the
secession. It was the only thing to do. Probably I could have given pardon; however, I
was not the one who gave pardon to Ojukwu. . . .
[I]n the case of Ojukwu, he had committed treason against the country! No matter

how you see it, as far as the Nigerian context was concerned, he was the guilty party.
In other areas, he would have been eliminated, and I thank God that He never put him
in my hands. Otherwise I would have found it very difficult to save his life, even
though I would try my best to save his life, because he was an old colleague, an old
friend. But the public pressure would have made it impossible. So that was what
happened in the case of people like Effiong. A few of the senior ones [who] were
directly involved, we felt they should go. I think Effiong was dismissed. All that
happened to the others was that they lost the few years of seniority gained during the
period of the civil war.2

In Ojukwu’s absence, Sir Louis Mbanefo, the chief justice, and General
Philip Effiong, the defeated republic’s leading military officer, met with a small
group of Biafran government officials and made the fateful decision to surrender
to the federal government of Nigeria. Effiong went on Biafran radio to announce
the capitulation, and he spoke to the fear-stricken populace, urging calm and
encouraging the troops to lay down their weapons. He announced that he was
currently negotiating an armistice with the federal government of Nigeria, and
that General Ojukwu had left the nation. This drew a very clear line between
what was going on in the country and what was about to happen—which was the
fall of Biafra.
Before that the defeat was already quite apparent. There were a few people
who refused to recognize it and planned to continue to fight. I did not feel that
continuing the conflict was an option at all. I felt that the best way to deal with
this tremendous disaster was to not prolong the agony but to bring it to a close.

—
In the end, Biafra collapsed. We simply had to turn around and find a way to
keep those people still there alive. It was a desperate situation, with so many
children in need, kwashiorkor rampant, and thousands perishing every week.
The notoriously incompetent Nigerian government was not responding to those
in need quickly enough. With ill-advised bravado Gowon was busy banning
relief agencies that had helped Biafra.3 It was in this environment of desperation
that some people said, Let’s go into the forest and continue the struggle. That
would have been suicidal, and I don’t think anybody should commit suicide.
We had spent nearly three years fighting, fighting for a cause, fighting to the
finish . . . for freedom. But all that had collapsed, and Biafra with it. A very
bitter experience had led to it in the first place. And the big powers prolonged it.
You see we, the little people of the world, are ever expendable. The big
powers can play their games even if millions perish in the process. And perish

they did. In the end millions (some state upward of three million, mostly
children) had died, mainly from starvation due to the federal government of
Nigeria’s blockade policies.4
General Gowon made a national broadcast on the eve of the official
surrender to announce the end of the thirty-month war that he said had claimed
over one hundred thousand military service men and women and over three
million Biafrans. His “no victor, no vanquished” speech5 as it has come to be
known, strove to strike a conciliatory tone, calling for the full reintegration of
Igbos into the fabric of Nigerian life. There was great celebration throughout
Nigeria and Biafra at the news of the end of the hostilities.
A day later, on January 15, 1970, the Biafran delegation, which was led by
Major General Philip Effiong and included Sir Louis Mbanefo, M. T. Mbu,
Colonel David Ogunewe, and other Biafran military officers, formally
surrendered at Dodan Barracks to the troops of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
Among the Nigerian delegation were: General Yakubu Gowon; the deputy
chairman of the Supreme Military Council, Obafemi Awolowo; leaders of the
various branches of the armed forces, including Brigadier Hassan Katsina, chief
of staff; H. E. A. Ejueyitchie, the secretary to the federal military government;
Anthony Enahoro, the commissioner for information; Taslim Elias, the attorney
general; and the twelve military governors of the federation.
At the end of the thirty-month war Biafra was a vast smoldering rubble. The
head count at the end of the war was perhaps three million dead, which was
approximately 20 percent of the entire population. This high proportion was
mostly children. The cost in human lives made it one of the bloodiest civil wars
in human history.6
The sequelae of wars often begin with an armistice. The suffering and
humanitarian disaster left in the wake of war’s destruction goes on long after the
weapons are silenced—for months and years. Entire towns and villages, schools
and farms in Biafra were destroyed. Roads and the rural areas were littered with
landmines that continued to maim and kill unsuspecting pedestrians well after
the hostilities ended. Many people had lost all that they owned. Loved ones in
the thousands were reported missing by families. There were stories of scores of
suicides. This was not just a case of Ani, or the land and its protector, the land
goddess, “bleeding,” as my people would describe catastrophic events of this
nature. It was worse: a case of Ani nearly “exsanguinating to death.”
My generation had great expectations for our young nation. After the war
everything we had known before about Nigeria, all the optimism, had to be

rethought. The worst had happened, and we were now forced into reorganizing
our thinking, expectations, and hopes. We (the former Biafrans) had to carry on
in spite of the great disaster that was military defeat and learn very quickly to
live with such a loss. We would have to adjust to the realities and consequences
of a Nigeria that did not appeal to us any longer. Nigeria had not succeeded in
crushing the spirit of the Igbo people, but it had left us indigent, stripped bare,
and stranded in the wilderness.

The Question of Genocide
I will begin by stating that I am not a sociologist, a political scientist, a human
rights lawyer, or a government official. My aim is not to provide all the answers
but to raise questions, and perhaps to cause a few headaches in the process.
Almost thirty years before Rwanda, before Darfur, over two million people—
mothers, children, babies, civilians—lost their lives as a result of the blatently
callous and unnecessary policies enacted by the leaders of the federal
government of Nigeria.1
As a writer I believe that it is fundamentally important, indeed essential to
our humanity, to ask the hard questions, in order to better understand ourselves
and our neighbors. Where there is justification for further investigation, then I
believe justice should be served.
In the case of the Nigeria-Biafra War there is precious little relevant
literature that helps answer these questions: Did the federal government of
Nigeria engage in the genocide of its Igbo citizens through their punitive
policies, the most notorious being “starvation as a legitimate weapon of war”? Is
the information blockade around the war a case of calculated historical
suppression? Why has the war not been discussed, or taught to the young, over
forty years after its end? Are we perpetually doomed to repeat the mistakes of
the past because we are too stubborn to learn from them?
We need not get into the prickly thicket of diagnosing the reasons for the
federal government’s attempts to fool the world about what happened in Biafra.
However, it may be helpful to start by defining the term genocide. Robert S.
Leventhal provides this description:
The term genocide derives from the Latin (genos = race, tribe; cide = killing) and
means literally the killing or murder of an entire tribe or people. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines genocide as “the deliberate and systematic extermination of an
ethnic or national group. . . .” By “genocide” we mean the destruction of a nation or
an ethnic group. The UN General Assembly adopted this term and defined it in 1946
as “ . . . a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups.”2

The Arguments
Throughout the conflict the Biafrans consistently charged that the Nigerians had
a design to exterminate the Igbo people from the face of the earth. This
calculation, the Biafrans insisted, was predicated on a holy jihad proclaimed by
mainly Islamic extremists in the Nigerian army and supported by the policies of
economic blockade that prevented shipments of humanitarian aid, food, and
supplies to the needy in Biafra.1
The argument extended by Harold Wilson’s government in defense of the
federal government of Nigeria is important to highlight:
The charges of Jihad have also been denied by British officials who assert that more
than half the members of the Federal Government are Christian, while only 1,000 of
the 60–70,000 Federal soldiers are Muslim Hausas from the North. (House of
Commons Debate, cited earlier.)2

Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe, professor of history and politics and an expert on
genocide, reminds us that supporters of the Biafran position point not only to the
histrionic pronouncements of the leaders of the Nigerian army—often dismissed
as typical outrageous wartime rhetoric—but to an actual series of atrocities, real
crimes against humanity, that occurred on the battlefield and as a result of the
policies of the federal government of Nigeria.
The International Committee in the Investigation of Crimes of Genocide carried out
exhaustive investigation of the evidence, interviewing 1082 people representing all the
actors in the dispute (the two sides of the civil war and international collaborators).
After a thorough painstaking research, the Commission concludes, through its
Investigator (Dr. Mensah of Ghana): “Finally I am of the opinion that in many of the
cases cited to me hatred of the Biafrans (mainly Igbos) and a wish to exterminate
them was a foremost motivational factor.” [Emphasis in original.]3

In his well-researched book The Brutality of Nations, Dan Jacobs uncovers a
provocative paragraph from an editorial in the Washington Post of July 2, 1969:
One word now describes the policy of the Nigerian military government towards
secessionist Biafra: genocide. It is ugly and extreme but it is the only word which fits
Nigeria’s decision to stop the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other
relief agencies, from flying food to Biafra.4

Jacobs also reveals the lamentations of Pope Paul VI over the Nigeria-Biafra
War:
The war seems to be reaching its conclusion, with the terror of possible reprisals and
massacres against defenseless people worn out by deprivations, by hunger and by the
loss of all they possess. The news this morning is very alarming. . . . One fear
torments public opinion. The fear that the victory of arms may carry with it the killing
of numberless people. There are those who actually fear a kind of genocide.5

The distinguished American historian, social critic, and political insider
Arthur M. Schlesinger provides this contribution on the dire situation in Biafra:
The terrible tragedy of the people of Biafra has now assumed catastrophic dimensions.
Starvation is daily claiming the lives of an estimated 6,000 Igbo tribesmen, most of
them children. If adequate food is not delivered to the people in the immediate future
hundreds of thousands of human beings will die of hunger.6

In what is likely to be the most compelling statement of the era from an
American president, Schlesinger provides this powerful extract from Richard
Nixon’s campaign speech on September 10, 1968:
Until now efforts to relieve the Biafran people have been thwarted by the desire of the
central government of Nigeria to pursue total and unconditional victory and by the
fear of the Ibo [sic] people that surrender means wholesale atrocities and genocide.
But genocide is what is taking place right now—and starvation is the grim reaper. This
is not the time to stand on ceremony, or to ‘go through channels’ or to observe the
diplomatic niceties. The destruction of an entire people is an immoral objective even
in the most moral of wars. It can never be justified; it can never be condoned.7

Two distinguished Canadian diplomats, Mr. Andrew Brevin and Mr. David
MacDonald (members of the Canadian Parliament), “reported that genocide is in
fact taking place [and] one of them stated that ‘anybody who says there is no
evidence of genocide is either in the pay of Britain or being a deliberate fool,’”
following a visit to the war-torn region.8 New York Times journalist Lloyd
Garrison, who covered the conflict, submitted harrowing accounts of genocidal
activity on the part of the Nigerian troops: “The record shows that in Federal
advances . . . thousands of Igbo male civilians were sought out and
slaughtered.”9
Supporters of the Nigerian federal government position maintain that a war
was being waged and the premise of all wars is for one side to emerge as the
victor. Overly ambitious actors may have “taken actions unbecoming of
international conventions of human rights, but these things happen everywhere.”
This same group often cites findings from groups (sanctioned by the Nigerian

federal government) that sent observers to the country during the crisis that there
“was no clear intent on behalf of the Nigerian troops to wipe out the Igbo
people, . . . pointing out that over 30,000 Igbos still lived in Lagos, and half a
million in the Mid-West.”10
The British government, wary of the morally bankrupt position that Harold
Wilson had toed from the onset of the conflict, sought to explain away their
reckless military adventure in Africa. There were real excesses to account for: If
the diabolical disregard for human life seen during the war was not due to the
Northern military elite’s jihadist or genocidal obsession, then why were there
more small arms used on Biafran soil than during the entire five-year period of
World War II?11 Why were there one hundred thousand casualties on the much
larger Nigerian side compared with more than two million—mainly children—
Biafrans killed? The government of Harold Wilson proffered what it called a
“legitimate strategy” excuse in which it postulates that the indisputable excesses
seen during the war were due to the Nigerian military’s “excellence”—clearly
making it the strongest candidate for an all-time foot-in-the-mouth prize.12

The Case Against the Nigerian
Government
It is important to point out that most Nigerians were against the war and
abhorred the senseless violence that ensued as a result of the conflict.
Gowon���s wartime cabinet, it should also be remembered, was full of
intellectuals like Obafemi Awolowo and Anthony Enahoro and superpermanent
secretaries like Allison Akene Ayida among others who came up with a boatload
of infamous and regrettable policies. A statement credited to Chief Obafemi
Awolowo and echoed by his cohorts is the most callous and unfortunate:
All is fair in war, and starvation is one of the weapons of war. I don’t see why we
should feed our enemies fat in order for them to fight harder.1

It is my impression that Chief Obafemi Awolowo was driven by an
overriding ambition for power, for himself in particular and for the advancement
of his Yoruba people in general. And let it be said that there is, on the surface, at
least, nothing wrong with those aspirations. However, Awolowo saw the
dominant Igbos at the time as the obstacles to that goal, and when the
opportunity arose—the Nigeria-Biafra War—his ambition drove him into a
frenzy to go to every length to achieve his dreams. In the Biafran case it meant
hatching up a diabolical policy to reduce the numbers of his enemies
significantly through starvation—eliminating over two million people, mainly
members of future generations.
If Gowon was the “Nigerian Abraham Lincoln,”2 as Lord Wilson would have
us believe, why did he not put a stop to such an evil policy, or at least temper it,
particularly when there was international outcry? Setting aside for the moment
the fact that Gowon as head of state bears the final responsibility of his
subordinates, and that Awolowo has been much maligned by many an
intellectual for this unfortunate policy and his statements, why, I wonder, would
other “thinkers,” such as Ayida and Enahoro, not question such a policy but
advance it?3
The federal government’s actions soon after the war could be seen not as
conciliatory but as outright hostile.4 After the conflict ended

the same hard-liners in the Federal government of Nigeria cast Igbos in the role of
treasonable felons and wreckers of the nation and got the regime to adopt a banking
policy which nullified any bank account which had been operated during the war by
the Biafrans. A flat sum of twenty pounds was approved for each Igbo depositor of the
Nigerian currency, regardless of the amount of deposit.5

If there was ever a measure put in place to stunt, or even obliterate, the
economy of a people, this was it.
After that outrageous charade, the leaders of the federal government of
Nigeria sought to devastate the resilient and emerging Eastern commercial sector
even further by banning the importation of secondhand clothing and stockfish—
two trade items that they knew the burgeoning market towns of Onitsha, Aba,
and Nnewi needed to reemerge. Their fear was that these communities, fully
reconstituted, would then serve as the economic engines for the reconstruction of
the entire Eastern Region.
The Enterprises Promotion Decree of 1974, also known as the Indigenization
Decree, was ostensibly pushed through by the leaders of the federal government
in order to force foreign holders of majority shares of companies operating in
Nigeria to hand over the preponderance of stocks, bonds, and shares to local
Nigerian business interests. The move was sold to the public as some sort of
“pro-African liberation strategy” to empower Nigerian businesses and
shareholders.
The chicanery of the entire scheme of course was quite evident. Having
stripped a third of the Nigerian population of the means to acquire capital, the
leaders of the government of Nigeria knew that the former Biafrans, by and
large, would not have the financial muscle to participate in this plot.6 The end
result, they hoped, would be a permanent shifting of the balance of economic
power away from the East to other constituencies.7 Consequently, very few Igbos
participated, and many of the jobs and positions in most of the sectors of the
economy previously occupied by Easterners went to those from other parts of the
country.
Ironically, and to the consternation of Lord Wilson and the British cabinet in
England, the Enterprises Promotion Decree of 1974 also meant that the
British/Dutch conglomerate Royal Dutch/Shell BP and other holdings valued at
$720 million at the time, would have to share ownership of oil investments with
the federal government—the very development Wilson was trying to avoid by
backing Gowon in the first place.8
For those who would defend Gowon’s cabinet, suggesting that at times of
war measures of all kinds are taken to ensure victory, I will counter by stating

that the Geneva Conventions were instituted after the Holocaust to make sure
that human rights are still protected in times of conflict.
There are many international observers who believe that Gowon’s actions
after the war were magnanimous and laudable.9 There are tons of treatises that
talk about how the Igbo were wonderfully integrated into Nigeria. Well, I have
news for them: The Igbo were not and continue not to be reintegrated into
Nigeria, one of the main reasons for the country’s continued backwardness, in
my estimation.10
Borrowing a large leaf from the American Marshal Plan that followed World
War II and resulted in the reconstruction of Europe, the federal government of
Nigeria launched an elaborate scheme highlighted by three Rs—for
Reconstruction, Rehabilitation, and Reconciliation. The only difference is that,
unlike the Americans who actually carried out all three prongs of the strategy,
Nigeria’s federal government did not. The administrator of East Central state,
Mr. Ukpabi Asika, announced that Eastern Nigeria required close to half a
billion pounds to complete the reconstruction effort. None of us recall that he
received anything close to a fraction of the request.
What has consistently escaped most Nigerians in this entire travesty is the
fact that mediocrity destroys the very fabric of a country as surely as a war—
ushering in all sorts of banality, ineptitude, corruption, and debauchery. Nations
enshrine mediocrity as their modus operandi, and create the fertile ground for the
rise of tyrants and other base elements of the society, by silently assenting to the
dismantling of systems of excellence because they do not immediately benefit
one specific ethnic, racial, political, or special-interest group. That, in my
humble opinion, is precisely where Nigeria finds itself today!

Gowon Responds
To get General Gowon’s point of view on a number of the same questions that I
have raised in this section of this book, I asked the eminent journalist and writer
Pini Jason to interview the former Nigerian head of state. A portion of the
interview is reproduced here:
PINI JASON: The Igbo still believe that they are being punished because
of the civil war. The Indigenization Decree is an [action], they point out,
that was taken when the group was economically weakened and thus, as
it were, kept them out of playing a role in the economy. They still feel
they are being punished because of the civil war.
GOWON: It is a pity that they think this way. The Indigenization Decree—
I think it was 1972 or ’73—that decree was really to ensure the
participation of every part of the country, unlike the privatization policy
now in place. Businesses are indigenized within one’s own area—in the
North, in the East, in the West, etc. And who are the beneficiaries in
those areas? It is mostly the people native to the particular area. And I am
sure that by 1972, many Igbo had recovered sufficiently enough to
participate, not only in their own area, but also in Lagos. You tell me,
who owns most of Lagos?
PINI JASON (CUTTING IN): Two years with twenty pounds; the Igbo
were still trying to find their feet! They were in no position to buy into
any company!
GOWON: No. Remember, what was being indigenized before it was
speeded up were some of the small Lebanese businesses, like textile
stores, in which, in any case, the Igbo were very well established,
yesterday, today, and even tomorrow. Probably in Lagos, they were not
able to buy into as many such businesses as they would have desired.
Otherwise, certainly I know that by 1972 there was sufficient recovery
enabling the Igbo to participate. Now the incident of twenty pounds that
you refer to was enforced immediately at the end of the war. Because
your economic gurus will tell you that because of your economic value,
you cannot exchange the Biafran note; what is it called?

PINI JASON: The Biafran pound.
GOWON: Is it the Biafran pound? But now, I am told that it is selling like
hotcake! I am told that it is being used especially in the West Coast! So I
said, Well, you see the ingenuity of the Igbo man? [General laughter]
People say it is even more valuable than the naira!
PINI JASON: Maybe as a collector’s item!
GOWON: But there it is! No. I think the policy of twenty pounds was
never an attempt to impoverish the Igbo people. The government was
very generous in giving funds to Ukpabi Asika so that the government of
the East could circulate money and get businesses off the ground, as well
as [to] embark on various rehabilitations and reconstructions that were
taking place. Probably the exchange rate in Nigerian currency for the
Biafran pound seemed not to be on equitable terms. If we said they could
exchange at par . . .
PINI JASON (CUTTING IN): I would have been a millionaire!
GOWON: You’re telling me! [General laughter] And probably bought off
the rest of the country! That was not the policy of indigenization. It was
meant to help. For example, the government was able to provide Asika
with funds so that people could get Nigerian currency even as a loan. It
was probably some of the bigger businesses indigenized later that you are
talking about, but that occurred only after my overthrow. The
government of Obasanjo, I think between 1975 and ’79, speeded up
taking over some of the big businesses, especially in Lagos, which was to
the advantage of his people, because they were the ones on the spot, and
a lot of their people were in the banks and knew how to use the banks to
give loans to their own people to buy some of these things. But this was
not the case in other parts of the country. So when it comes to that, you
can rest assured that it was not only the Igbo that felt left out; other parts
of the country that were not as well positioned as the people from the
West felt the same way.
PINI JASON: Another issue was that of abandoned property, especially in
Rivers state, and the context in which your government allowed some
property belonging to the Igbo to be taken over. The case was made by
the new Rivers state government that its people were like tenants in their
own state. After you left office it became clear that several individuals
actively exploited the issue, buying up former Igbo-owned property and
using these properties as collaterals for business ventures, often obtaining

loans from banks controlled by certain people with anti-Igbo sentiments.
Many blamed [this] series of developments around abandoned property
on you. What is your reaction?
GOWON: There was no doubt that it was a very knotty issue. I think there
should have been justice and fair play. And as far as I was concerned,
although pressure was being brought by the governor and the government
of Rivers state at the time, my position was, if any property was to be
taken for the use of the government, it had to pay proper compensation.
And true enough, I think at the time, there were many Igbo who wanted
to sell their property. Therefore, there was hardly any problem from that
point of view. But I know that later the Rivers state indigenes themselves
became fully involved, and virtually pressurized the subsequent
government.
I think, honestly, that a lot of the damage was not done during our
time. At least, we were keeping it under control, and working hard to
ensure that there was justice. Since it was one Nigeria, we must allow
people who wanted to come back to at least come back to their business
and properties. But I know that quite a lot of this did not happen
subsequently, and it left a very bad feeling that, as you said, the Igbo
were being penalized because of the war. I am not sure of what really
happened at that time, since I was away from the country. But I know
that my effort was not to deprive people of their property. Those who
wanted to sell did so at the market price at the time. But those properties
the government wanted for their use, it was to pay the economic rate at
the time. Of course, policies changed thereafter.1

Nigeria’s Painful Transitions: A
Reappraisal
The post Nigeria-Biafra civil war era saw a “unified” Nigeria saddled with a
greater and more insidious reality. We were plagued by a homegrown enemy: the
political ineptitude, mediocrity, indiscipline, ethnic bigotry, and corruption of the
ruling class. Compounding the situation was the fact that Nigeria was now
awash in oil-boom petrodollars, and to make matters even worse, the country’s
young, affable, military head of state, General Yakubu Gowon, ever so cocksure
following his victory, proclaimed to the entire planet that Nigeria had more
money than it knew what to do with. A new era of great decadence and decline
was born. It continues to this day.
At this point, the intellectuals, particularly the writers, were faced with a
conundrum. We could no longer pass off this present problem simply to our
complicated past and the cold war raging in the background, however significant
these factors were. We could not absolve ourselves from the need to take hold of
the events of the day and say, Okay, we have had a difficult past. . . . From today,
this is the program we have; let’s look at what we have not done. Of course,
putting it this dramatically makes the matter appear simple.
However, it became crystal clear that we needed to fight this new enemy
with everything at our disposal. Most important, Nigeria needed to identify the
right leader with the right kind of character, education, and background.
Someone who would understand what was at stake—where Africa had been, and
where it needed to go. For the second time in our short history we had to face the
disturbing fact that Nigeria needed to liberate itself anew, this time not from a
foreign power but from our own corrupt, inept brothers and sisters!
After waiting around a while and determining that no messiah was about to
come down and save the day, some of us joined the political process. I joined the
left-of-center Peoples Redemption Party and was appointed its deputy national
president. The goal of being an active participant in Nigerian politics would be
to elevate the national discourse to a level that stirred up the pot, if you like, and
got Nigerians to begin to ask critical questions about their future, such as: How
can the country conduct free and fair elections? How can we elect the right kind

of leaders and ensure that they will keep to the tenure that was agreed upon?
How do we ensure that our leaders don’t double their tenure, or even change it
into a dynasty to hand over to their sons?
My sojourn in politics was marked by disappointment, frustration, and the
realization that despite the fact that there were a few upright political figures like
Mallam Aminu Kano, the vast majority of the characters I encountered in the
political circles were there for their own selfish advancement. Having grand
ideas was fine, but their execution required a strong leader. And clearly,
Nigeria’s principal problem was identifying and putting in place that elusive
leader.

—
That road to a remedy of Nigeria’s political problems will not come easily. The
key, as I see it, lies in the manner in which the leadership of the country is
selected. When I refer to leadership I am really talking about leaders at every
level of government and sphere of society, from the local government council
and governors right up to the presidency. What I am calling for is for Nigeria to
develop a version of campaign election and campaign finance reform, so that the
country can transform its political system from the grassroots level right through
to the national party structures at the federal level.
Nigerians will have to find a way to do away with the present system of
godfatherism—an archaic, corrupt practice in which individuals with lots of
money and time to spare (many of them half-baked, poorly educated thugs)
sponsor their chosen candidates and push them right through to the desired
political position, bribing, threatening, and, on occasion, murdering any
opposition in the process. We will have to make sure that the electoral body
overseeing elections is run by widely respected and competent officials chosen
by a nonpartisan group free of governmental influence or interference. Finally,
we have to find a way to open up the political process to every Nigerian citizen.
Today we have a system where only those individuals with the means of capital
and who can both pay the exorbitant application fee and fund a political
campaign can vie for the presidency. It would not surprise any close observer to
discover that in this inane system, the same unsavory characters who have
destroyed the country and looted the treasury and the nation blind are the ones
able to run for the presidency!
The question of choice in selecting a leader in Nigeria is often an academic

exercise, due to the election rigging, violence, and intimidation of the general
public, particularly by those in power, but also by those with the means—the
rich and influential. There is also the unpleasant factor of the violence associated
with partisan politics that is often designed to keep balanced, well-educated, fairminded Nigerians away. So it can be said that the masses—the followership we
are concerned about—don’t really have a choice of leadership, because there’s
not a true democratic process.1
It may appear impossible now to rectify, because we’ve allowed this
situation of confusion to go on since our independence. It has been growing
steadily worse . . . and it accelerated particularly under the military, when there
was a near total denial of the democratic rights of the people. The general
knowledge that a people have, for example, inalienable rights is simply
something advanced societies take for granted, because they have fostered stable
democracies now for some time. I am asked, “Why don’t the people fight back?”
Well, once a people have been dispossessed and subjugated by dictatorships for
such a long time as in Nigeria’s case, the oppressive process also effectively
strips away from the minds of the people the knowledge that they have rights.
Restoring flawed democratic systems will not make the country a success
overnight.

—
The Igbo are a very democratic people. The Igbo people expressed a strong
antimonarchy sentiment—Ezebuilo—which literally means, a king is an enemy.
Their culture illustrates a clear-cut opposition to kings, because, I think, the Igbo
people had seen what the uncontrolled power of kings could do. There is no
doubt that in their history they experienced the high-handedness of kings, so
they decided that a king cannot be a trusted friend of the people without checks
and balances. And they tried to construct all kinds of arrangements to whittle
down the menace of those with the will to power, because such people are there
in large numbers in every society. So the Igbo created all kinds of titles that cost
much to acquire. Aspirants to titles, in the end, become impoverished in the
process and end up with very little. So that individual begins again, and by the
time his life is over, he has a lot of prestige but very little power.
Democracy is the very antithesis of military or absolutist rule. And
democracy is not a fancy word; it is something that is full of meaning, even in
our ancient African cultures. Dictatorships by their very nature concentrate

power and the resources of the state in the hands of a very few people (or, as we
have seen in Africa, in one person’s hands). Dictators hang on to power by
resorting to tactics designed to keep the mass of the people silent and docile.
Dictatorships that have used violence, murder, and bribery, and psychological,
financial, and social intimidation to force the opposition into perpetual retreat are
many and widespread.2
This is not a time to bemoan all the challenges ahead. It is a time to work at
developing, nurturing, sustaining, and protecting democracy and democratic
institutions. Winston Churchill perceptively said, “Democracy is the worst form
of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to
time.”3 We have to go by that wisdom. Therein lies an opportunity for Great
Britain, America, and the West to be involved positively in African affairs, this
time not by imposing themselves or their self-selected rulers on a desperate
continent but by aiding African nations in their struggles to become viable
democracies.
We also realize that we must learn patience and not expect instant miracles.
Building a nation is not something a people does in one regime, or even in a few
years; it’s a very long process. The Chinese had their chance to emerge as the
leading nation in the world in the Middle Ages but were consumed by interethnic political posturing and wars and had to wait another five hundred years
for another chance!
Another crucial ingredient in sustaining a democracy is the ability to stage
free and fair elections. The last general election in Nigeria was not perfect, but
overall it was an improvement over past travesties that were passed off as
elections in Nigeria. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC),
Chairman (and professor) Attahiru Muhammadu Jega, and his team should be
allowed to build upon the gains of that exercise for the good of the nation.

—
I think it is important to discuss some real events that occurred during Nigeria’s
Fourth Republic (circa 2004), during which the very opposite of the democratic
ideal was at work. Anambra state, the past home of several venerated Nigerians,
such as Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Okigbo brothers—Pius and Christopher—Kenneth
Dike, and others—was literally and figuratively on fire. There was a succession
of events during a tussle for political power that resulted in renegades arresting a
sitting governor and buildings being looted and government property ransacked

and burned to the ground by hoodlums—those infamous rent-a-crowd hooligans
at the beck and call of corrupt politicians with plenty of money and very low
IQs.
What seemed almost incredible to me was that it was clear from all accounts
that the presidency was behind the chaos in the state—was encouraging the
destabilization of the government of Anambra state as well as encouraging a
small group of people whose sole interest seemed to be in getting their hands on
the financial allocation made to the state. In other words, to use the money that
was intended for work on the state for their own private ends—and that these
were friends of the president.
For any clear-headed observer such a scenario would be unimaginable—that
the head of state, or his government or his office, should be encouraging crime in
one of the federation’s constituent states, encouraging anarchy in a part of the
country, Nigeria. That state, of course, as you might know, is also my home
state. It’s also part of Igbo land, which has had a peculiar history in Nigeria,
some of which involves this particular former president of Nigeria—his attitude
to this part of Nigeria, which he and some like him consider responsible for the
troubles of the Nigerian civil war. And so it just seemed to me totally
irresponsible for leadership to be involved, to be promoting chaos instead of
preventing it. It was in a sense the very end of government itself, where
government leaps beyond the precipice, dismisses itself, and joins ranks with
crime.4
I decided that I wasn’t going to be part of any of this. Elie Wiesel reminds us,
“There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must
never be a time when we fail to protest.”5 I had very little at my disposal to
protest with, so the strongest statement I could make was to turn down the honor
of commander of the federal republic, which I was awarded.

Corruption and Indiscipline
Corruption in Nigeria has grown because it is highly encouraged. In The Trouble
with Nigeria I suggest, “Nigerians are corrupt because the system they live under
today makes corruption easy and profitable. They will cease to be corrupt when
corruption is made difficult and unattractive.” Twenty-eight years after that slim
book was published, I can state categorically that the problem of corruption and
indiscipline is probably worse today than it’s ever been, because of the massive
way in which the Nigerian leadership is using the nation’s wealth to corrupt,
really to destroy, the country, so no improvement or change can happen.
Recently, out of despair, I stated, “Corruption in Nigeria has passed the alarming
and entered the fatal stage, and Nigeria will die if we continue to pretend that she
is only slightly indisposed.”
The World Bank recently released numbers indicating that about $400 billion
has been pilfered from Nigeria’s treasury since independence. One needs to stop
for a moment to wrap one’s mind around that incredible figure. This amount—
$400 billion—is approximately the gross domestic products of Norway and of
Sweden. In other words, Nigeria’s corrupt ruling class stole the equivalent of the
entire economy of a European country in four decades! This theft of national
funds is one of the factors essentially making it impossible for Nigeria to
succeed. Nigerians alone are not responsible. We all know that this corrupt cabal
of Nigerians in power has friends abroad who not only help it move the billions
abroad and help them hide the money, but also shield the perpetrators from
prosecution!

State Failure and the Rise of Terrorism
In 2011, Nigeria was ranked number fourteen in the Failed States Index,1 just
below other ��havens of stability”—Afghanistan, Somalia, and Iraq! State
failure has many definitions, so I will bother the reader with only two short
descriptions relevant to the Nigerian situation:
[A failed state] is one that is unable to perform its duties on several levels: when
violence cascades into an all-out internal war, when standards of living massively
deteriorate, when the infrastructure of ordinary life decays, and when the greed of
rulers overwhelms their responsibilities to better their people and their surroundings.2
[Failed States are seen in] instances in which central state authority collapses for
several years.3

Economic deprivation and corruption produce and exacerbate financial and
social inequities in a population, which in turn fuel political instability. Within
this environment, extremists of all kinds—particularly religious zealots and other
political mischief makers—find a foothold to recruit supporters and
sympathizers to help them launch terrorist attacks and wreak havoc in the lives
of ordinary citizens.4
Over eight hundred deaths, mainly in Northern Nigeria, have been attributed
to the militant Islamist sect Boko Haram5 since its formation in 2002. The
group’s ultimate goal, we are told, is to “overthrow the Nigerian government and
create an Islamic state.”6 In many respects, Nigeria’s federal government has
always tolerated terrorism. For over half a century the federal government has
turned a blind eye to waves of ferocious and savage massacres of its citizens—
mainly Christian Southerners; mostly Igbos or indigenes of the Middle Belt; and
others—with impunity.
Even in cases where their hands were found dripping in blood, the
perpetrators have many a time evaded capture and punishment. Nigeria has been
doomed to witness endless cycles of inter-ethnic, inter-religious violence
because the Nigerian government has failed woefully to enforce laws protecting
its citizens from wanton violence, particularly attacks against nonindigenes
living in disparate parts of the country. The notoriously (some say conveniently
so) incompetent Nigerian federal government, and some religious and political
leaders, have been at least enablers of these evil acts. I have stated elsewhere that

this mindless carnage will end only with the dismantling of the present corrupt
political system and banishment of the cult of mediocrity that runs it, hopefully
through a peaceful, democratic process.

State Resuscitation and Recovery
Many pundits see a direct link between crude oil and the corruption in Nigeria,
that putting in place an elaborate system preventing politicians or civilians from
having access to petrodollars is probably a major part of a series of fixes needed
to reduce large-scale corruption. For most people the solution is straightforward:
If you commit a crime, you should be brought to book. Hold people responsible
for misconduct and punish them if they are guilty. In a country such as Nigeria,
where there are no easy fixes, one must examine the issue of accountability,
which has to be a strong component of the fight against corruption.
Every Nigerian knows that there should be accountability, that people should
be accountable. But if the president—the person running the whole show—has
all of the power and resources of the country in his control, and he is also the one
who selects who should be probed or not, clearly we will have an uneven system
in which those who are favored by the emperor have free rein to loot the treasury
with reckless abandon, while those who are disliked or tell the emperor that he is
not wearing any clothes get marched swiftly to the guillotine!
Nigeria’s story has not been, entirely, one long, unrelieved history of despair.
Fifty years after independence Nigerians have begun to ask themselves the hard
questions: How can the state of anarchy be reversed? What are the measures that
can be taken to prevent corrupt candidates from recycling themselves into
positions of leadership? Young Nigerians have often come to me desperately
seeking solutions to several conundrums: How do we begin to solve these
problems in Nigeria, where the structures are present but there is no
accountability?
Other pressing questions include: How does Nigeria bring all the human and
material resources it has to bear on its development? How do we clean up the
Niger Delta? What do we need to do to bring an end to organized ethnic bigotry?
How can we place the necessary checks and balances in place that will reduce
the decadence, corruption, and debauchery of the past several decades? How can
we ensure even and sustained development? And so forth. . . . And that would be
a big debate to keep Nigeria busy for a long time.
The Sovereign National Conference that was held a couple of years ago was

a good idea. I believe the concept was right—a platform to discuss Nigeria’s
problems and challenges and pave a path forward—however, the execution was
not. Debate about a nation’s future should not turn into an excuse for politicians
to drink or feast on meals in Abuja. It should continue for decades, in small
forums, in schools, offices, on the radio, on TV, in markets, in our newspapers,
and on the streets, until we get things right. Most advanced nations in the world
constantly appraise and reappraise their countries’ paths and destinies.
I foresee the Nigerian solution will come in stages. First we have to nurture
and strengthen our democratic institutions—and strive for the freest and fairest
elections possible. That will place the true candidates of the people in office.
Under the rubric of a democracy, a free press can thrive and a strong justice
system can flourish. The checks and balances we have spoken about and the
laws needed to curb corruption will then naturally find a footing. A new patriotic
consciousness has to be developed, not one based simply on the well-worn
notion of the unity of Nigeria or faith in Nigeria often touted by our corrupt
leaders, but one based on an awareness of the responsibility of leaders to the led
—on the sacredness of their anointment to lead—and disseminated by civil
society, schools, and intellectuals. It is from this kind of environment that a
leader, humbled by the trust placed upon him by the people, will emerge, willing
to use the power given to him for the good of the people.

AFTER A WAR
After a war life catches
desperately at passing
hints of normalcy like
vines entwining a hollow
twig; its famished roots
close on rubble and every
piece of broken glass.
Irritations we used
to curse return to joyous
tables like prodigals home
from the city. . . . The meter man
serving my maiden bill brought
a friendly face to my circle
of sullen strangers and me
smiling gratefully
to the door.
After a war
we clutch at watery
scum pulsating on listless
eddies of our spent
deluge. . . . Convalescent
dancers rising too soon
to rejoin their circle dance
our powerless feet intent
as before but no longer
adept contrive only
half-remembered
eccentric steps.

After years
of pressing death
and dizzy last-hour reprieves
we’re glad to dump our fears
and our perilous gains together
in one shallow grave and flee
the same rueful way we came
straight home to haunted revelry.1

POSTSCRIPT: THE EXAMPLE OF NELSON
MANDELA

N

ot too long ago my attention was caught by a radio news item about
Africa. As I had come to expect, it was not good news, and it was not
presented with, nor did it deserve, respect. It was something of a joke. This was
the announcement of the death of President Eyadema of Togo, whom it
described as the longest-serving president in Africa (or maybe the world—I
forget which). Then it gave another detail: Eyadema had died from a heart attack
even as he was about to be flown to Europe for treatment. And it concluded with
the information that Eyadema’s son would succeed him as the next president of
Togo!
If Eyadema stayed that long because he was so good, why was there no
hospital in Togo to attend to his condition? Did Eyadema, who had given
nothing but bad news to Togo since the 1960s, imagine that the solution to
problems created largely by him would be solved by a dynasty of Eyademas?
Which reminded me of another First Son: the son of the president of Equatorial
Guinea, who was seen around the world on television as he shopped
extravagantly in Paris for expensive clothes. Unfortunately, he seemed no less a
bum in the suits he was trying on than out of them.1
This event brought me once again face-to-face with Africa’s leadership
charade. What do African leaders envision for their countries and their people? I
wondered yet again. Have they not heard that where there is no vision the people
perish? Does the judgment of history on their rule mean anything to them? Do
they remember how a man called Mandela, who had spent twenty-seven years in
prison for South Africa, gave up the presidency of that country—a position that
he so richly deserved—after only four years and made way for another and
younger patriot? Why do African leaders choose bad models like Malawian
president Kamuzu Banda instead of good ones like Mandela? Have they

considered how Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has ruined the cause of
land distribution by demagoguery and a thirty-year tenancy in power?
Which makes me wonder whether any of these life presidents consider how
Mandela became the beacon of justice and hope on the continent, indeed for the
world. For those who do not know, Mandela did not have an easy life. He fought
alongside African heroes such as Steve Biko, Walter Sisulu, and Oliver Tambo,
among other brave activists, for the liberation of his people from one of the most
racist systems the world has ever known. For his efforts, he was sent to prison.
Most men would have been broken, or consumed by bitterness. But not
Mandela. This giant among men walked free that fateful day, on February 11,
1990, after nearly three decades of imprisonment on Robben Island, hands held
high, fist in the air. His release was beamed across the planet. The world was
pleased, but nowhere as ecstatic as his African brethren around the globe, who
saw in Mandela the personification of their highest aspirations and the
embodiment of the kind of leadership Africa needs desperately.
Mandela has delivered magnificently on those dreams. And it is to this great
man, lovingly known as Madiba—father of the nation of South Africa,
antiapartheid leader, lawyer, writer, intellectual, humanitarian—that present and
future African leaders must all go for sustenance and inspiration.

APPENDIX
Brigadier Banjo’s Broadcast to Mid-West1

NOTE: “BRIGADIER” BANJO WAS THE COMMANDER OF
THE BIAFRAN INVASION
Benin, August 14, 1967, at 20:00 GMT.
Fellow Nigerians and Biafrans, I am sure I do not need to introduce myself
either to you nor perhaps to many people outside our country. You have already
had ample opportunity to hear of my name in January 1966 when this political
crisis started in our country. Unfortunately at that time I also only heard about
the circumstances under which my name was being publicized at a time when I
was in no position to do anything about it. I was then accused of having
attempted the life of the late Supreme Commander, Maj.-Gen. J. T. U. AguiyiIronsi, and that for the attempt I have been arrested and detained.
Fellow Nigerians, nothing could be further from the truth. The mutiny in the
Army which started the revolution in January 1966 was as much of a surprise to
myself as it was to some of my colleagues. I spent all of my time [words
indistinct] of the events in ascertaining the true state of affairs in the country. My
colleague, then Lt.-Col. Yakubu Gowon, was the first officer who gave me
precise information about the state of affairs. It then appeared to me that
sufficient had taken place to ensure the removal of several Governments of the
Federation and that the sum total of the trend of events could be regarded as the
beginning of a national revolution. I then considered it my duty to ensure that no
further military action took place which might have the effect of totally
destroying the stability of the nation.
I felt that the young officers who had started the action were only anxious to

destroy what had become a most corrupt and discredited Government. As such, I
spent a considerable time in an effort to urge the late Major General to assume
responsibility for the State with the support of the Army from national collapse.
It was then my view that any attempt to use the Nigerian Army for any military
action within Nigeria would only have the effect of breaking the Army into its
tribal components of which the Northern component would represent the lion’s
share. This Northern component, effectively under the control of the Northern
feudalists, would then inevitably be employed to impose on the rest of Nigeria
the most repressive feudal domination. I was one of the senior officers of the
Nigerian Army who took the decision to accept responsibility for Nigeria. In
fact, on that occasion I was the chief spokesman for that decision. I therefore
considered it my duty to remain with the General as closely as possible rather
than accept the office of the Military Governor of the West which he then
proposed to me and which I declined in favor of the late Lt.-Col. Adekunle
Fajuyi. On the day after the General had assumed full responsibility for the State
I was arrested by a few of my colleagues while waiting to see the General. I was
never given a reason for my arrest, nor given an opportunity to defend myself
against any charges that could be raised. I went to prison for 14 months under a
false accusation, the details of which I only found out from the press and radio
after I got to prison. I have since had the opportunity of speaking to the so-called
actors in that drama of my arrest, and I now appreciate that the action was an act
of hatred motivated primarily by fear and suspicion. I spent a considerable part
of my time in prison sending warnings to the late Major-General and my
colleagues about the policies that would appear to represent a continuation of the
policies of the Balewa Government, which could have the effect of encouraging
counterattempts, which might not only destroy the Nigerian Army but would
also, by the extent of the bloodshed and the tribal selectiveness of the [word
indistinct], destroy the Nigerian nation as well.
The inevitable has now happened, which would seem to confirm that my
fears were well-founded. There is now an army at the disposal of the feudal
North, an army that has lost all the traditions, discipline, and standards of a
responsible army. There is now a Government of the Federation that is sustained
by violence and is therefore tied to the ambitions of the Northern Feudalists.
There has been a considerable amount of bloodshed, chaos, and tribal bitterness
among such people. Such tribal rivalry, as used to be exploited by our previous
political parties for the harnessing of the opinion of the North and its people, is
now translating itself into a most extreme form of brutality and of despicable

savagery.
Finally, the dismemberment of our nation has commenced in the breakaway
of Biafra. In August 1966, I wrote to my colleagues from prison to inform them
that I did not consider that we, military leaders of this country, had the right to
carry out such action as the proclamation of the dismemberment of presiding
over the dismemberment of Nigeria. I still do not think that we have the right to
destroy a nation that was handed over to us to save at a moment of crisis. The
29th July 1966 Federal Military Government came into being as a result of a
mutiny in which the primary action was directed at the elimination of a
particular ethnic group and the supremacy of another ethnic group in Nigeria.
This has had the effect of destroying the basic mutual trust and confidence
among the people of Nigeria and has created the decentralization of the Nigerian
people into tribal groups. This action, more than any other event that has
occurred throughout the history of Nigeria, has had the greatest effect on the
dismemberment of Nigeria. The Federal Military Government cannot claim to
represent the Government of the people of Nigeria and to fight for the unity of
Nigeria while constantly rejecting fundamental human rights for all people
forming parts of Nigeria. The Federal Military Government cannot claim to be
seeking a peaceful solution to the problems of achieving Nigerian unity while at
the same time contemptuously ignoring the wishes of the people of the MidWest and the West in their previous demands for the removal of the unruly
troops of the North from their territories in order to allow the unfettered
discussion of the present political crisis.
The Federal Military Government cannot claim to be genuinely interested in
the progress and welfare of the Nigerian people while at the same time inflicting
the bloodiest warfare on the people of Nigeria and employing unscrupulous
foreign mercenaries in a total war that really destroys hundreds of our people
and the economy of our nation. . . .
The people of Biafra have a right to fight a Government that has constantly
treated its people to the most savage forms of brutality and persists in denying
these people its fundamental human rights while claiming to represent other
interests. It is my view that the people of Biafra were prepared to remain part of
the nation into which they have for so many years invested their resources of
manpower and material and with which they had the closest social ties. Provided
the people of Biafra could live within such a nation under a Government that
truly represents all sections of its people and truly tries to pursue such measures
as are designed to promote the welfare of all Nigerians irrespective of tribe or

religion [sic] [sentence as broadcast]. It is the remnants of the old Nigerian Army
that broke away in July that now threatens the Nigerian nation. This Northern
army is now under the power and control of a group of Northern feudalists who
have as their aim the total conquest of Nigeria. The Federal Military
Government, having been brought to power and control by that army, is playing
to that end. Hence policies are inevitably directed toward achieving the
objectives of the Northern feudalists who control that army. . . .
It is my idea that the peaceful settlement of the Nigerian problem will be
readily achieved when that fragment of the Nigerian Army now at the disposal
of the Northern feudalists has been completely disarmed. Toward this end, the
Liberation Army is irrevocably committed. It is not at all an invasion, and it is
not intended to promote the domination of any group of the Nigerian people by
any other group through the presence of the Liberation Army. I wish to stress
once again what I said during the press conference and previously on the radio,
that the movement of this Army into the Mid-West is not a conquest. It is also
not an invasion. It is to enable the people of the Mid-West to see the Nigerian
problem in its proper perspective. I firmly believe that the people of the MidWest would prefer to be able to declare their stand in the conflict that has arisen
in Nigeria free from any [pressure] either from the North or from anywhere. I
believe that the people of the Mid-West would like to be given an opportunity to
state their case, free from the coercive influences due to the presence of Northern
troops. It is my view that the political future of Nigeria rests with all the people
of Nigeria. It has become a matter of great concern to me, however, to be
informed that certain ethnic groups are jubilating as a result of the presence of
the Liberation Army in this Region. As a consequence, I also understand that
certain other ethnic groups are feeling depressed and frustrated. I wish to assure
all ethnic groups in the Mid-West that the achievement of the Liberation Army
does not give any ethnic group an advantage over any other. I wish also to appeal
to all ethnic groups to exercise restraint and humility and not to indulge in acts
which may result in confusion, bringing distress to a large number of our people.
Any misbehavior on the part of any group of persons will give rise to a chain of
unpleasant reactions. . . .
I am informed that since the Liberation Army came into the Mid-West a
number of civil servants have become so frightened that they have either refused
to come to their places of work or reported only for a few hours and then left
before the closing time. I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to all civil
servants to return to work not later than 15th August 1967, and to assure them of

their safety. Those, however, who fail to report on this day will be in danger of
permanently losing their jobs. . . .
While on the question of cooperation among the various ethnic groups in the
Mid-West, I would like to stress that all tribal meetings should stop, as such
meetings are not conducive to peace and mutual understanding. In order to foster
cooperation among the people of the Mid-West, I propose within the next few
days to invite a cross section of the people of the Mid-West to a meeting to
explain to them the present situation and objectives of the Liberation Army, and
I believe this will go a long way to giving them the true picture of the situation
and instill confidence in the future of the Mid-West. I understand that anxiety is
being expressed in some quarters about the safety of the Military Governor of
the Mid-West, Brig. David Ejoor. I wish to inform you that I have personally
held discussions with Brig. Ejoor and to assure you that he is in good health and
is not under detention. . . .
I have, therefore, today promulgated a decree setting up an interim
administration in Mid-Western Nigeria. This decree has suspended the operation
in Mid-Western Nigeria of the Constitution of the Federation of Nigeria, the
Constitution of Mid-Western Nigeria, and other constitutional provisions
applicable in Mid-Western Nigeria, except those constitutional provisions
absolutely necessary for the efficient functioning of the machinery of State. All
legislative and executive powers have been vested in me during the period of
interim administration. In order to assist me in the task of administering MidWestern Nigeria during the interim period I propose to appoint a military
administrator and an administrative council. I have also established a MidWestern Nigerian Army and a Mid-Western Nigerian Police Force, which will
for the moment remain independent of the Nigerian Army, the Nigerian Police
Force, the Biafran Army, or the Biafran Police Force. The Mid-Western Nigerian
Army shall, however, during this interim period be part of the Liberation Army.
All courts in Mid-Western Nigeria shall continue to function as usual and it may
be necessary to establish a court of appeal until it becomes possible to resume
[words indistinct] the Supreme Court of Nigeria. As soon as it is practicable I
propose to hand over the administration of Mid-Western Nigeria in order to
proceed to the war front and to complete the liberation of Nigeria.
Good Night.
